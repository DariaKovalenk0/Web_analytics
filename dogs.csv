chickadeedeedee_,Lessen frequency of pees and poops while feeding kibble?,5,2024-06-05 16:58:28+00:00,"I'm at my wits end here with trying to feed our dogs. I'll try to break it down quickly. 

Dogs:

Arlo- ~6 year old mix, 50lbs and slightly overweight, possible food allergies

Penny- 10 month whippet, about 30lbs and healthy weight 


Currently eating:

Arlo- premixed raw boar from local store

Penny- premixed raw chicken/beef from same store, added to purina pro plan sensitive skin and stomach puppy


I would really like to get them off the raw food for several reasons... cost, availability, storage issues, convenience, etc. We are going on holidays for 2 weeks and I hate to leave my in-laws with all this raw food and 20 step feeding regime.

We previously had them both on purina one. The biggest issue was Arlo was drinking a TON if water while eating it, resulting in going out constantly, including the middle of the night (which he has never needed). He also was pooping 3+ big poops a day... a bigger issue because Penny loves to eat his poop, and it's much harder to prevent that when he's going so often. 

We switched him to raw (he'd done well on it before years ago) and he now drinks a normal amount, and poops one small poop a day. 

So... is there anyway for us to switch them both to kibble but maintain the positive results of the raw for Arlo? I've looked at doing half freeze dried raw but it's just way too expensive. 

I've tried adding a bunch of water or even broth to the kibble but it seems to put them both off of it, if it's enough to make the food ""soggy"". 

Would adding some canned food help? I looked at the purina stuff but it said to do 3/4 can a day for Arlo while mixing with the kibble... that nearly $4 a day in just wet food. 

Any help or advice please?? I just want an easy-ish feeding plan that keeps them both healthy and keeps us sane (I.e. not waking up all night to let them out). ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d8uw2t/lessen_frequency_of_pees_and_poops_while_feeding/

I can't tell if she's having fun or just stressed.,2,2024-06-05 16:25:23+00:00,"My boyfriend and I adopted a rescue dog about a year ago. She's half lab/half pit. We love her to death and she's very sweet with us and relatively calm at home. Leash walking is slowly improving with lessons. However, it seems like leaving our apartment complex actually really stresses her out. Like part of me thinks she's enjoying it, because she always wants to get in the car, but whenever we get somewhere she starts whining and almost, like, crying. The one exception is the softball field to play fetch, that always goes smoothly.

But last week we took her to the lake, and I know she likes to splash around, my mom has a kiddie pool that she got to go in when we visited. But like, she was freaking out at the lake. She wanted to go in, and she kept like biting the waves, but she was simultaneously crying and she had this worried expression on her face. We tried to tie her up for a little so we could swim, but she was crying so much we couldn't. When we got in the car she seemed to like, pass out from exhaustion. It's the same thing when we go on hikes or walks around little ponds or whatever. She's sniffing around and all, but she'll also be whining a lot, and it's almost like she's so overwhelmed with the novelty of her surroundings that it becomes stressful.

Any advice? Should we just try to keep things routine for her? What do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d8u3gl/should_i_keep_taking_my_rescue_dog_on_excursions/

I love all dogs and I am not anti-pitbull. However, I understand the reality that they are strong dogs, and that I don’t think they would be the right fit for me personally. 
This dog I am looking to adopt is mostly GSD. His dad is full GSD, and the mom is a very mixed medium dog. Apparently the mom’s DNA test is like 21% pitbull, with some chihuahua/husky etc thrown in. 
I’m really trying my best to be responsible here. I take commitment to an animal VERY seriously, so I try to be thorough in the process to ensure a dog that is compatible with my lifestyle so that I can give the dog the life they deserve. 
I have just read of many stories in which pitbulls can be very dog aggressive. That they were sweet as puppies, and then one day in adulthood something tragic happens and the owners say “they have never done this before!”
Other than the concern of the pit part, he seems like the perfect pup for me. Checks all the boxes. Is supposedly very chill but likes to go for run and plays.

But now he’s very aggressive, he wants to jump at every dog that walks by.

Yesterday my brother took him on a walk and said that my dog tried to BITE another dog.

I’m continuing to keep him away from other dogs but I just don’t know where this came from and why he’s doing this, it’s a complete 180

alwaysconfused__,Running with dog without creating an athlete? ,34,2024-06-05 13:03:46+00:00,"I’m an active person that enjoys walking for long distances (10-15km trails) and have recently gotten into running. I plan on getting a standard poodle in the near future - I know they can’t be run until their plates close. However, I’m wondering what the best way to go about running or hiking with my dog (when it’s old enough) without creating an athlete?

I ask this because I live in Canada- and while I am happy to do 10-15 km most days in the summer, it’s impossible in the winter (trails are not maintained, it’s freezing, and the snow is knee deep). My concern is that this type of activity from spring to late fall will be very difficult to reduce during the 3-4 difficult winter months. Additionally, I would really like to keep the dog with me because it adds an additional layer of “protection” (deterrent I guess?) since I’m a small woman and can’t carry much for safety. 

Any advice is appreciated! Please be nice- I’m new to dogs and running (but not walking/hiking). Thank you :)

My brother will tell him to go outside, and he’ll walk right out. But I tell him the exact same way, and he won’t. He just stares at me and then walks to his kennel.
 I pat the couch and tell him to come over to me, and again he just goes to his kennel. He only listens to me if I’m pouring his food; which, in that case, I’m not even telling him to do anything! 
He also barks and jumps at me when I go upstairs, because we have a baby gate (he’s not usually allowed up there). He’ll sometimes bark at my brother, but nobody else; and it’s worst with me. He’ll jump at me and try to bite at my hands (it doesn’t seem like he’s trying to BITE bite, but it doesn’t seem playful either?). 
I don’t know why he’ll listen to everyone but me. Does he just not trust me? We’ve had him for 2 or 3 years now, and we weren’t having this issue until maybe a year ago. I don’t know why he started doing this. Any ideas??",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d8ofy2/my_dog_wont_listen/

Hello, first of all thank you for reading this. 

My dog is 2 and a half years old now and everytime I tried to take him to vet, vet said his blood values are not good enough. After each medication use I took him back to vet again to get him checked for neutering. After this happened like 5 times vet determined he is simply incredibly allergic to MANY things. 

After that I gave up on neutiring him. But I am considering trying again simply because people keep telling me how I should do it.  

For context, my dog is quite small, around a poodle size. He is very non aggressive. He lives with a cat and they usually never fight, when they do its always the cat that wins. About breeding, I dont think I want to breed him and I am very careful next to other female dogs. Stopping him is not a problem if I think he gets too close. He does mark trees but he doesnt hump anything or tried to harm other male dogs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d8n29q/is_neutiring_a_good_choice_for_us/

FerdySpuffy,Life enrichment for aging pup with weak legs,20,2024-06-05 02:05:44+00:00,"Hello, r/dogs!

I’m looking for some guidance and suggestions for my aging pup, a 14-year-old, 24-pound shepherd mix who's always been a bundle of energy.

**Background**: Over the past year, he’s slowed down significantly, started eating less and lost some weight, and grown a bit weaker, especially in his hind legs -- They shake when he stands, he can't finish peeing without putting his leg down, and he's been stumbling on curbs during our walks. He's also stopped jumping up on the couch to snuggle in the evenings, and he'll either wander around and circle the couch while we sit, or he'll just stare at us until we pick him up (which hurts him if we don't do it just right).

**A few things we've tried**: We’ve been to the vet, and tried an oral pain med that didn’t help. He just got his first injection of a new one, but they said it could take a month to see results, if we see them at all. We also give him melatonin in the evenings, which seems to relax him enough to chill on the couch. For the couch situation, we have puppy stairs he could use to get up more easily, but he refuses to use them.

**What I'm looking for**: Despite all this, he’s still a happy pup at heart. He gets excited for walks and has bursts of puppy-like energy, and he hardly seems to notice his difficulties, outside of the pain when we pick him up. With all that said, I don't think it's time to start talking about end-of-life just yet, and I’m looking for ideas to improve his current circumstances.

One specific thing I'd like input on is the couch situation. I'm trying to think of products I can buy that will help him get back up on the couch as easily as he used to. Maybe there's a good product out there like a jacket with a handle that will help spread out the pressure when we pick him up? What else would you try here?

Are there any other products you'd suggest for enrichment? Or any other general advice you'd have for this situation?

riccarjo,Weekend getaway ideas for dog that gets anxious in new places?,4,2024-06-04 16:25:00+00:00,"My dog is pretty anxious and is really only ok being left alone if she's at home, but it makes traveling difficult.  We tried to bring her to a dog-friendly hotel last year and stupidly thought she would be ok in the room alone while my wife and I got dinner.  We weren't even able to get to the elevator on our floor before hearing her crying, barking, and scratching.  Even if she did calm down, we felt so bad that we wouldn't have been able to enjoy dinner.

We've worked on her separation anxiety for a while now, and she's great when she's home, so this is solely anxiety brought on by new places.

She also does not like being tied up, so even if we brought her to a sit-down restaurant, she'd get anxious and pace.

However, she *loves* the outdoors, and we live in the city so I'm always trying to figure out ways to get her more outdoor time.  My wife and I work from home on Friday, so I was thinking of finding a cabin or Airbnb by a lake or beach where my dog can be with us, get outdoor time, and my wife and I can still enjoy a getaway without feeling confined to a small hotel room.

Just trying to find a good balance for all of us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d81cpv/weekend_getaway_ideas_for_dog_that_gets_anxious/

I have a 10 month old toy poodle and he’s the greatest little guy ever. He loves to play, very healthy, and gets to go outside on a walk at least 3-4 times a day(depending on how big the walks are, sometimes we only do 3 if he’s had a bigger walk). My problem is he is really good outside, but I don’t know how to practice or teach that we also chill while outdoors. I wanna be able to teach him to sit down and have a picnic with my partner and I or come fishing with me, but as of right now he has so much energy and so curious that it’s hard to get him to stay in one spot. He’s very good indoors about catching the que when playtime is over and it’s time to chill but have a lot of trouble getting this accomplished outdoors. The goal is just to be able to have him be able to hang out outdoors for like an hour without having to watch every single one of his movements. While he’s always leashed, I still keep a close eye on him cause he’s got demon energy and tries chewing through his leashes for fun lol any tips are appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d7wgrh/tips_on_getting_dog_to_chill_outside/

So when I 100% trusted boutique brands, it was all “add so many nutritional toppers” “add as much raw and fresh foods in their diet as possible” but when I looked different opinions people say that if your food is nutritional balanced we don’t need the toppers. I like to make my girl different types of frozen molds. Are those still ok to add as a topper? Are toppers really just extra calories even if I portion them correctly? I don’t use raw toppers anymore. I stick to just hydrated kibble, but I still love to make little freezies for her! 

Also Purina sent me a discount for beggins treats. My dog absolutely loves those, but I always hear how bad they are for her. Would it be ok to get one bag to use as recall treats (super high quality)? I practice recall like 1-3 times a day. Is that too much? Are those treats actually bad?

Fenrir_Hellbreed2,Any advice for dealing with debilitating separation anxiety? ,11,2024-06-04 11:05:11+00:00,"
So, I just recently got a Husky (aprox 1.5 years old according to previous owner) and apparently he's been shuffled around a bit. As a result he's crazy clingy, which isn't a problem when I'm home since he basically just follows me every time I get up and move around. Honestly he's not even particularly vocal or sassy (still has his moments though), mostly just a little stubborn. 

All in all he's pretty much the perfect dog until he's left home alone. 

The first time I left him home alone while I was at work he destroyed the bottom half of my front door and took out a decent portion of the frame (metal screen door is still intact so he didn't get out) and managed to injure himself in the process. The door and frame have been temporarily patched with duct tape to keep bugs out while I fix/replace it. 

So I got him a kennel to keep him contained while I'm at work. It's possible that I missed a few hooks (honestly not sure) but either way he somehow managed to force his way out. Thankfully there was no extra damage to the house besides a moderately frustrating mess and a ripped couch (the couch still works so I really don't mind the damage, also already patched it with color matching duct tape). He also was not further injured (did need a quick bath though). 

I'll be reinforcing the kennel with zip ties to be extra sure he can't just force his way out again but ideally I'd like to work on getting to a point where he doesn't go off when I leave. 

.

Some extra details for context:


I'm a single dad with a job that's not pet friendly so staying home or taking him with isn't an option. 

He's not yet fixed and likely hasn't had all of his shots (I'm working on that, though). 

The injury was not severe. Just a cut on the top of his head that had already stopped bleeding by the time I got home (I still cleaned it with peroxide and isopropyl alcohol just to be safe).

cubemissy,Does this mean my rescue dog might be remembering some puppy training?,1,2024-06-04 04:02:37+00:00,"My 6-ish year old girl is a terrier/gryphon/shih tsu. mix. She’s shaped like a footstool with feet, and her greatest wish is to be sleeping ON someone, anyone. Or partaking in your dinner. 

She does what she wants, ignores anything she doesn’t like. We have developed a few family things, like doing “Jazz Hands!” when playing. We don’t put a lot of demands on her; she’s easy to care for. 

When these little potato shaped dogs want onto the bed, and are not inclined to use the ramp you bought….you end up bent way over, hands out, trying to coax her close enough to be picked up….and they stand there, staring at nothing, with the “I’m evaluating my options” face…. Recently, I think I’ve unlocked some puppy training. Because when I lower my voice, put my hand out, and say “come”, it’s like she jolts out of the Maybe state, she trots right up, and touches the palm of my hand with her nose, then looks up at me. 

I think she was in a puppy class somewhere, and I’m really proud of her for remembering that command. So, of course she gets all the praise and pets and “Clever girl!” from us…

She’s so much better than when we got here at 2 months old, but she’s still having frequent accidents.

I let her out 4 times a day; usually 7am, 12pm, 5pm, 9pm.

She’s great some days and has no issues, but she’ll have a week where every day she’s making several mistakes. Especially when she’s not supervised. The moment I take the trash out, go to my building’s laundry room, check the mail, etc, she’ll poop or pee inside. Even if she’s been out recently.

She’s a very smart dog and knows she’s not supposed to. I can usually tell she peed somewhere before physically finding it because she acts afraid like she’s in trouble.

She also doesn’t seem to fully go when we’re outside, it never ever comes to a dribble and ends. She pees for 10 seconds and then stops midstreams and walks on.

We’ve played this game where I’ll keep walking her hoping she’ll finish, after 20 minutes come inside and she goes.

I’ve tried rewarding her for going outside, but no matter the treat, even cooked chicken, she’s not interested when outside.

It just feels like she made a lot of progress and now she’s content with being halfway potty trained. Obviously all dogs are different, but my last pup picked it up within a year and got good enough where we could go on a longer walk twice a day and be good. She can’t even with 4+ walks a day, and with work I can’t take her out every 1-2 hours.

My problem is my GSD is wicked smart and strong enough to brute force things he can't figure out. Our whole house is baby proofed because he can open the fridge and doors and help himself to food or let himself out for a walk. He gets all his food in puzzles and as rewards for solving tasks, he's involved in herding lessons and scent training to keep his brain from taking over the world and he's mostly a very good boy who uses his powers responsibly. 
His only weakness is the wet cat food. We've bought a microchip feeder that he breaks into, we've put the feeder on a high shelf he climbs, and behind numerous gates (each more sturdy than the last) that he opens or breaks down. 
The key is he only does this bad behavior when he knows he can get away with it because we're out of the house, so correcting him is difficult. Anyone else had luck with other methods?

She used to curl up with us or spread out on the floor, but now she really struggles to relax in the evening until it's bedtime. She sleeps with us and is totally okay once we're both in the bed with her. 

Her physical health is great. She walks every day and gets the zoomies and all that. If you saw her, you'd never guess she was 14. Of course, she gets confused some during the day, but the vet has said that's normal for her age. 

I'm looking for suggestions on how to help her settle down at night. She's not much of a cuddler, so we've not had much luck soothing her that way. Has anyone dealt with this before? I'd love some tips",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d7qip8/advice_for_night_anxiety/

This is where I tell you about my amazing 2 year old German shepherd.

He has stuck by my side every moment of the day, resting when I rest, giving me love when I ask for it. If he hears me run to the bathroom he will drop whatever he is doing (even if he’s halfway through his food) to run to the bathroom with me and watch out over me. Whenever I’m done throwing up he’s very affectionate.

I feel terrible that I haven’t been able to walk him the past few days, but I’ve been making up for it with lots of treats and telling him what a good boy he is. He is such a huge source of joy in my life and I’m so grateful to have him by my side. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d7qznc/my_dog_has_been_the_most_incredible_support/

Murky_Broccoli_6580,Hoping for some advice,2,2024-06-04 09:02:57+00:00,"TLDR: German Shepherd husky mix portraying resource guarding and aggression behavior patterns towards other small male dog

Hey all, I was hoping I could maybe get some second opinions on ways I can help some behavior problems in our dogs. We have 3 dogs, a large Shepherd/Husky mix who was a pound puppy (has a not ideal past), Oakley. He's about 4 years old and 90 pounds. We have a street rat lab I scooped up off the side or the road when she was dumped as a puppy and she is just such a loveable dog, Margo, she is a 2 year old flat coated black retriever  and 60 pounds. And lastly my Fiances dog she's had since we were teens, he's about 7, and small Maltese mix 15 pounds, Jackson. All 3 dogs are fixed 

The issue is the big one Oakley. I suspect a lot of his behavior comes from his upbringing. He was a pound dog to start and my ex partner at the time was not very good to him. Probably one of the worst ones was when he got in a fight and she snapped at him and I had to physically pull my partner back to prevent her from actually punching my dog in the head. Needless to say that relationship didn't last. Oakley was kennel trained from a young age but maybe too well. He started getting very protective of his kennel and wouldn't let other dogs near it and didn't like us being near it. (Me and my current partner have worked on this so now he's okay with us being in it even). He also developed a food resource guarding issue as he aged that seems to only have gotten worse with age. 

Oakley confuses me, I can't tell if he's a very insecure dog that lashes out, or if he's an extremely cocky or dominant dog. When it's him and I alone on a walk he does great, doesn't tug, doesn't react to other dogs, walks by my side with his ears slightly back and a relaxed pace. On the same token, he's very easily spooked. For being such a big dog, he's such a weeny. Spooked by things he's unsure of and creates distance to bark at the thing and approach very slowly until he's decided it's safe. Then moving into his interactions with the other dogs and it's the opposite. During feeding time they are fed a strict diet at specific times. We used to be able to set the bowls down and let them eat next to each other, then a few fights broke out so we had to distance the bowls. Then he would lay over his bowl, head low, ears back, and look very unsure at the other dogs while they ate and only eat after the other dogs have finished and left the room on their own. We were then told to hand feed Oakley to help with the resource guarding and getting him used to our scent on his food and I will say I think it's helped? He's completely fine with us and the food considering he only gets fed through our hand so he's fine with it. He will still sometimes wait to eat from us, until the other dogs have cleared out

Margo is an angel, she's a typical lab, loveable, no issues, plays sorta rough which we do interrupt when Oakley starts displaying his hackles, but overall she's great, no issues, super obedient and sweet, just stinky. Margo is great at avoiding Oakley triggers I think? I don't know what it is but Oakley is not bothered by Margo. She knows to avoid him during feeding, she knows when to give him space when he's being grumpy. Oakley has pretty much never snapped at Margo. Even when he's being grumpy to her, she brushes it off like nothing happens, ignores his warning signs and will lick his ear or something until he shakes his head, bows, and the grumpy turns into play.

Jackson is much smaller than the other but he is a very cocky small dog. He's not aggressive but is constantly, constantly trying to hump the other dogs given the chance. We make him stop when he does that. He's a barker, always barking, and puffing his chest out at things around the yard but overall he's fine. He doesn't portray any signs of aggression over food or anything, very obedient, just the constant humping makes me assume he's always trying to assert dominance

We also have a cat, all dogs are fine with cat, but Oakley is not very fond of her. Oakley will usually move if the cat bugs him and he doesn't like her in certain places, he'll get up and herd her away from random places. Changes by the day. 

The issues mostly are between Oakley and Jackson. Oakley does try to gaurd us. If we're relaxing on the catch he tries to squeeze up there. If we're laying in bed he tries to sleep on it with us. We make him get down and lay on his bed as I've read that him thinking he's equals to us by sleeping in the same bed is bad news. Jackson is small and to my annoyance manages to sneak his way up on the couch or bed without waking us so we don't even notice he's up until we wake up. I predict this creates some jealousy from Oakley but my Fiance doesn't agree. There has been far too many times lately where Oakley has been getting in a fight with Jackson over just where Jackson is. If he just so happens to be too close to his kennel, or trying to play with a toy Oakley wants, or on the dog bed Oakley will often growl and lower his head, and then snap at him and start a fight. We do interupt as soon as we see it but sometimes it happens so fast. Jackson doesn't back down, he snaps back and they get all loud for a second but we've never really seen any actual physical biting, they sound like a really loud warning nip maybe? No injuries on either dogs. It is becoming an issue that seems to get worse. Oakley just got in a fight with Jackson, 1am dead of night and I have no idea why. Seemed Jackson was trying to get on our bed. We'd love to have kids some day but what if our child wanders to close to his kennel or food bowl? It's concerning behavior that I don't really know how to address. Money is really tight in this economy so I'm trying to read and try methods that can help but maybe someone here can help point me in the right direction to help with the aggressive resource guarding he displays. Any advice is greatly appreciated. 

 
EDIT: I should add there was a period where I had to room with some friends and they had a lab that had toy aggression issues that rivaled Oakley. We were there for 2 years and they got in many fights. Fights where I'd have to step in and physically pull the dogs off each other by their scruff. Oakley would give a warning nip and the other dog would let loose a full fight. Oakley didn't seem to ever actually bite down but the other dog did and Oakley did have blood on him multiple times after the fights. Then other days the 2 were best friends playing outside. I tried to keep them separate as possible. There was also another time when a family friend with a known, very dog aggressive dog, didn't check and put their large dog outside while Oakley was out and the dog attacked Oakley. I had to run outside to get this strangers dog away from him and Oakley just stood there awkwardly, not fighting back or warning or anything while this other dog was trying to bite his neck. I fear Oakley growing up with that dog, and my ex as examples have taught him that he needs to be very defensive and gaurd pretty much everything. Life is much more peaceful now and we have property with land and play and toys and a partner that supports me and the dogs and it's so much better than it was. Oakley just seems to be getting worse as he gets older  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d7snvb/hoping_for_some_advice/

Kerbart,Traumatized by fireworks,2,2024-06-04 03:52:52+00:00,"Last week on memorial day I was walking my dog at night when someone, many, many blocks away, decided to light some fireworks (on Memorial day.

I felt bad for him but didn't think too much of it, aside from ""poor pup.""

However, since then he doesn't want to go out when it's dark. He'll be barking and is very excited to put his harness on, but once we get to the door and he sees it's dark outside he'll pancake. I managed to convince him to go outside *once*, and that was a short walk to the end of the driveway (""How long is your driveway?"" ""I live in Bergen County, NJ"") and that was it.

Unusual behaviour? ,4,2024-06-03 13:37:58+00:00,"I was really hesitant about moving him from my family home. He’s 14 years old, slightly blind, going a bit deaf.

I thought it would be selfish for me to take him, but I spoke to a lot of people to get second opinions and they said he’d adjust over time. I love him so much. I couldn’t bear the pain of him thinking I had left him there. 

Anyway, one odd thing I’ve noticed is that at about 7pm while my partner and I hang out in the lounge, my doggo likes to sleep outdoors on his bed. He never used to do this.

He does sleep inside, and when we’re off to bed, he’ll sleep in his bed beside us, but I don’t understand why he’s wanting to be outside all of a sudden, especially if it’s cold or windy. Is he unsettled? Confused? Wants to protect the backyard? Likes the smells? I’ve never seen him want to sleep outside at night so I get really worried. 

The setup we’ve got at the moment, is that our desks are by the sliding door that leads to outside (where his bed is). Maybe he likes that we’re nearby and he can sleep outside?

NotAllAltmer,Why do other dogs hate my dog?,53,2024-06-03 17:23:26+00:00,"I have a 2 year old purebred not-fixed male Beagle named Rocco. Like most beagles, Rocco is extremely friendly and during walks loves to say hi to other people and other dogs. 

However, the issue is that a lot of dogs we encounter do not like my dog. Rocco would usually try to approach them to sniff them and, if the owner gives me permission, I let him do so. Sometimes he will howl at dogs he is particularly interested in saying hi to (again, with the owners permission).

When he finally approaches tho, dogs are either disinterested in him or sometimes straight up hostile. They growl at him or bark to get him away, sometimes even lunging fake bites out of nowhere. 

I don’t know why this happens. Rocco is not overly intense, he usually just sniffs around and then walks away or becomes a bit playful if the dog is more receptive. He is never aggressive, never even growls and, if a dog does threaten him, Rocco lays down belly up, which I have read it means he doesn’t mean any harm and is just submissive.

So why is this happening? And is there any way to make my dog more likeable to other dogs?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d7a0gl/why_do_other_dogs_hate_my_dog/

BananaJoy_,Help! My dog is “submissive peeing” on my couch and carpet and I don’t know how to help! ,7,2024-06-03 20:16:13+00:00,"So, my dog Bunny is a ~1.5 year old golden doodle. She is generally very well behaved. I got her about a year ago when she was about 18-19 weeks old from someone who was rehoming her, so she had a previous owner as a young puppy. 

When we first got her, she would “excited pee” a lot. Any time my partner or I used an excited voice around her, let her out of her cage, or she met anyone new, she would pee. I thought at first it was an excitement thing but discovered that it was actually more of a “showing submission” thing. I think her previous owners may have been pretty harsh with her, and this may have started this habit. 

Over time, she grew out of it. She gained confidence through learning tricks and I think just generally gaining trust with us. However last week, I came home on my lunch break to take her on a walk, my daily routine, and she had chewed something up (we leave her loose in the house, usually she is good not to chew anything) and made a mess of it all over the apartment. I was angry, and I yelled at her, saying bad girl, bad dog, etc. then she started peeing where she sat on the couch and I could tell it was out of fear/submission. I stopped and cleaned everything up, and then felt bad that I scared her like that. But I know plenty of people who yell at their dogs, or rub their nose in things or bop their nose when they’re bad (we don’t do this with Bunny) so I was just surprised that she would be that affected just by my raising my voice. 

So, at that point I know okay, no yelling at her, it doesn’t help anything anyway, as most experts would say dogs don’t even comprehend negative reinforcement. So next day, I go to leash her for a walk and she playfully runs away from me. She does this often, so I very playfully, while laughing actually, say “noooo silly girl come here!” And she begins peeing again. So this time I did not raise my voice or use a negative tone at all, the word “no” must have triggered it. I felt so bad. 

Today, I came home and looked around and saw nothing chewed up, so I said “awww good girl good job” etc in a calm, casual normal tone and patted her head, and she once again began peeing. So now it’s like no matter what I say, if she feels any sort of excitement whether it be praise or negativity, she pees on my couch or carpet. Similar to when she was a puppy but even more easily triggered than that. 

So now, what do I do??? I don’t want to clean up pee every time I speak directly to my dog, especially in a fully carpeted rental apartment lol. Do I just have to spend the next few weeks gaining back her trust??? Should I try to “ignore” her a little bit to avoid these instances? I live with my partner so she’d still get plenty of attention, just not from me. I’m not sure what else to do, just would love some insight or advice on the situation.

No-Sherbet2588,6 month old puppy kicked from daycare,12,2024-06-03 19:05:33+00:00,"Hello, my 6 month old puppy (lab and bully breed mix) just got kicked out of his daycare where he had been going for 3 months for being too excited and not picking up on other dogs social cues. They had previously said he was doing well at the daycare and we hadn't had many issues previously. I wanted to ask if this sort of behavior can be trained out of a dog or addressed in some manner? He has had no aggression issues with anyone or anything and truly his main issue is just that he gets extremely excited and is 50 pounds. I walk him regularly (5-6 times a week for at least an hour) besides that he has the ability to stay in our apartment and previously went to his daycare 2-3 times a week. I am at a loss for what to do here and cannot tell if it is his fault for his behavior or the employees fault for mismanaging him considering he had been there for 2.5 months with little to no issues and when I asked they didn't have a specific reason/instance for his behavior today. The other reason I am inclined to blame them is that their wording to explain it was upsetting as they said this is just how his breed behave's and there is nothing I can do and he is untrainable due to his energy. When I then pointed out he was trained for sit, stay, down, come here, and fetch she just said that she was surprised. They also said that he wasn't able to find specific dogs that matched his energy/vibe however, they had directly said that he had those dogs that he played really well with two visits ago when I asked if he had friends. Going to doggy daycare and seeing those dogs is legit the highlight of my dogs life so I want nothing more than to find some way for him to be able to go back to one even if it's not that one. This is my first dog and my first ever doggy daycare and I was under the impression until today that everything was going well and he was performing as expected. He has had zero problems with aggression or nervousness with any people or dogs and didn't have any problems with any specific dogs. TLDR: Can I train my puppy to be calmer around other dogs and would he then likely work in doggy daycare? And do you have any addditional advice for a frustrated first time dog owner?

caninebaby,Need in cabin airline travel advice for 13 pound rescue corgi mix,7,2024-06-03 19:01:11+00:00,"Hi all. I’m about to adopt a 13 pound corgi mix. She looks short and chubby and it’s hard to believe she’s only 13 pounds but the rescue  swears she was 11 pounds in February and now she’s 13 pounds. I do not have her length and height measurements. She is in Puerto Rico (Miracles for Satos Rescue) and apparently the vet also said she was 1 year two months old but how can you tell age to such precision of a dog left abandoned  tied to a fence?  What if she is younger and still growing. 

The videos and stills of her are absolutely wonderful and she’s being lovingly taken care of by a foster. I only have one freak out. My husband is Canadian and I live in Brooklyn, New York and I am going to have to fly with my baby probably four or five times a year because he is up there often caring for his 94 year old mother. Also we are in our late 60s and in 10 years we might be too old to to drive back-and-forth when we need to visit family.  There was this fantastic Reddit thread 4 months ago that was helpful but also concerning.   None of the carrier cases that I have researched are exactly what the airlines are asking. Virtually all of them that would fit my dog but are about an inch too high according to the airlines stated regulations. Still, of course, people have said they just smooshed them to fit under the seat, and usually don’t have a problem but sometimes if you hit a really nasty airline worker they won’t let you fly and you are toast.  

And also, I would love to know in people’s experiences who is better, Air Canada or WestJet. There’s a carrying case on Amazon for about 50 bucks that one Reddit contributor recommended  but the negative reviews said that the straps sometimes broke and the dog almost got hurt. Then there’s what looks like a perfect one on Roverlund for $159 but again, it’s 1 inch higher than Air Canada will allow and WestJet demands an even smaller carrying case that as one Reddit person said, a hamster couldn’t even stand up in. 

Any advice would be wonderful! I’ve heard Delta is better than American Airlines in terms of in-cabin pet travel.  Other great tips I got on Reddit  are to get a window seat, don’t sit behind the Premiere Economy seats, and you can’t sit on exit rows, keep a blanket over the case because it calms some dogs, possibly vet prescribed trazodone but never give your pet any drug without the vet prescribing it. 

Thanks in advance! I’ve always had big mixed dogs and my last one died December 2, 2023.

SpecialistSquirrel29,Do I Get A Second Dog For My First Dog's Sanity?,32,2024-06-03 19:03:29+00:00,"My husband (27) and I (26) got a German Shepherd puppy back in August. We live in a large apartment that we puppy proofed and spend time with him playing along with buying him toys and puzzle toys for him to play with by himself. We do have a yard, however, it is not fenced in, and we are unable to get it fenced. We take our pup outside regularly and my husband takes him on walks twice a day. He's now weighing in at 75% of my body weight and I've been having trouble controlling him on walks so it's something we're working on with training.
We have been planning to house hunt this year but after an unexpected medical emergency that required payment out of pocket, we won't have a down deposit for a house until early next year. Our Shepherd is turning 1 in a few weeks and is a ball of energy that without a fenced yard in the near future , I feel awful that he's so cooped up with two parents who play with him but can't play with him to the extent that a GS needs. So now the thought has crossed my mind on getting a second dog, which I understand is sort of silly because we're still without a fenced yard and then it'd be two dogs without one. However, my thought process is that with a friend of equal size and energy, our GS would be able to burn more energy and fulfill himself more mentally, physically and socially with another dog to play with inside so that it almost counterbalances in a way the lack of a yard to regularly exercise in. We are able to afford the cost of a second. 

Am I being silly about the idea? Should I bring it up to my husband? I'm so very confused about this and I just want to do the right thing for our dog. He's our first of our own and I want to do the right thing for him, and us. Please let me know your thoughts.

He is still eating, wagging his tail, sniffing curiously, and attempts at play which is why I think he still enjoys life and should remain on Earth for now. I've known this dog his whole life and see him monthly, if not more frequent.  I'm not keeping him around because I can't let go.

I worry about how this dog will navigate a new home, learn where his food/water bowls are, and how he will signal he needs to bathroom. I work from home so I'll be with him all day, but my room is upstairs. Should I isolate him to one floor?

This dog was given free access to a dog door and typically goes outside, though he has accidents inside occasionally. I plan on using dog diapers for him as but he's not used to going inside. Can I even teach him to pee on a grass pad inside? He can't hear or see + he's so old so how can I train him? I already have 2 neutered pitbills in my house currently.

Oystercracker123,Landlord Won't Tie Up Dog Away From Entrance,1,2024-06-03 03:29:22+00:00," Hey guys, just need some advice here.

My landlord has a 6 month old Bernese Mountain Dog. It weighs probably 40lbs now and is still definitely a puppy and loves to jump on people. I do love the dog, but man it can be too much for me sometimes.

I live on the second floor above my landlord's garage. Landlord has made a habit of tying the dog up right in front of my steps so it has more access to the yard, but I often have to fend off the dog while I'm climbing up or down, sometimes with heavy gear in my hands. I have had to change shirts before work because they got covered in mud from her claws, and have had scratches and cuts.

My landlord seems not to care. I have asked once in person for the pup to be chained up in a spot it can't get to my entrance, and then two other times over text thereafter. Landlord has said ""I'm trying to find a spot where dog won't get wrapped around stuff."" This is just rude right? I frankly think me not getting scratched is more important than the dog not having full access to the yard, or my landlord once in awhile having to walk out into the yard to unclip the dog because it wrapped itself around a tree. I eventually just took to wrapping the rope around the post it was tied to so the dog couldn't get to me, to find it totally unwrapped, and having to fight the dog off of me to get out of my apartment. I'm really sick of this. My landlord just seems like an airhead who doesn't understand people very well. Do I just keep asking?

Weve only had him a week. He growled at me and snapped at me once, then growled and full on tried to attack my older dogs two more times for coming near him. At this point we just threw all the bones in the trash and were like wtf??? 

At this point, we are looking into professional training and avoiding bones. I listened to a podcast on this issue from a channel I trust and used to train my golden retriever, but this 11 week old goldendoodle (80% poodle 20% golden) showed resource guarding for the first time today. 

The podcast I listened to is actually posted on youtube by McCann dog training, labelled Avoid Puppy Possessive Aggression with this strategy- S2 Ep 11. They essentially said that actual aggression (barking, snapping, whites of eyes, etc.) that we saw all in this doodle were things you needed professional help for. Essentially if we try to do it on our own, we are probably going to make it worse unless we know what were doing. 

My question is, wtf is causing this behavior in an 11 week old puppy? I’ve literally never seen this crap before in my two previous dogs and while I do still love him, I’m starting to seriously have doubts about him. 

TLDR: my goldendoodle 11 week old puppy just full on tried to attack my older dogs for getting near his bone and snapped at me. What causes this?? Was it caused from the breeder?

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
  
\* I do have a slight preference for rescuing a dog as that is what I know, I am open to buying from an ethical and reputable breeder.  
  
3)Describe your ideal dog.  
  
\*  I would like my dog to be friendly with other dogs, children and animals. A dog happy to come to farmers markets and sit under the table at cafes with me (I'll be sitting at the table not under though!). I would love to take my dog camping and on long walks but I would love a snuggle bug and couch potato. Willing to compromise on some things if the dog is otherwise perfect!  
  
4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
\* No particular breed!  
  
5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
  
\*  Definitely some training, sit, stay, down, come, wipe your mouth (if slobbery!) /feet, bark are what I think of immediately, willing to compromise on those higher order ones.  
  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
  
\* No competing for us!  
  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
  
\* Probably a 1-2 hours during the week as I will be working full time but much more on weekends.  
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
  
\* Probably 1-2 30 minute walks a day. Doggy day care once a week.

Several times a week (summer) - beach walk and swim, dog park, nature park walks.

Once weekly? - A longer walk, may be hilly, with gravel/dirt paths. Could be several hours long (with breaks, not essential for the dog to come but it would be nice).

I would also like to take the dog camping and on short local holidays.

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\*  Can do weekly brushing plus extra cleaning if needed (like having been for a muddy walk or swim etc.) I am willing to learn how to do this but also invest in a professional if needed.R

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)What size dog are you looking for?

\* Pretty much anything but not great dane or Irish wolfhound big.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\*  A little barking is okay if its alerting to someone by the door or similar. I think grumbles and mumbles are super cute! Shedding is a-okay. Some drool is okay, willing to compromise on this.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* Not essential. I would like to take a dog to the beach and to swim and camp, but happy to do that with a leash.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* Snuggly dog!

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

\* I would like the dog to listen but a little stubbornness is okay. I don't really want a dog who wants to be at my every call.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* Bark alert for the door or someone in the garden would be nice but I would also like a dog to be friendly to visitors?!

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* Cannot manage this.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* No escape artists please!

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* Unfortunately, 8-12 hours four days a week. Could be longer could be shorter some days. Doggy day care the fifth working day.

Several hours on the weekend potentially if the dog can't come wherever I go.

I hope to go away for a few weeks a year (unlikely in this financial climate), but I will have a known and experienced dog sitter (my sister!).

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

\* N/A

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

\* Potentially some poultry.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* Potentially whilst out and about, and I don't want to worry about my dog and children interacting (obviously supervised though).

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* Small owned house with a small garden.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* Australia.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* Summer average is 29c but can get to mid 40cs, winter average is 15c but can get below 5c. We will definitely have AC lots of ice cubes and ice treats, tiles to lie on for summer and a heater and many blankets for winter.

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

\* Average week will look like at least one walk for 30 mins in the suburbs with a possible additional nature park walk, doggy park visit and some beach walks and swims. Alone for 8-12 hours four days a week with plenty of puzzles and toys set up whilst I am gone. Doggy day care one day a week. Lots of outings on the weekends, cafes, markets, drives (in a crate do not fret! if the destination is doggy friendly!). We will also have daily snuggles. Thanks everyone!

_SoSublime_,"Picky eaters will drive you up a wall, but don’t give up",3,2024-06-03 05:10:44+00:00,"Long post, but bear with me. It’s been a long road, and finally seeing some hope on the horizon. 

I’ll start with, I love my girl. She’s a sweet, loving, energetic baby. But my god, she is a picky, picky, picky eater. She has been picky since she was first taken home by me. She has always eaten, but not without coecion or simply begrudgingly. At first I thought “maybe it’s appetite”, but no. This dog will nuzzle away and walk away from her bowl refusing to eat, but will greedily eat, well, anything else (she has also never been fed any human food). Yak chews? Loves them. Pig skin rolls? Loves them. Freeze dried chicken, salmon, beef liver, sheep liver. Loves it. Her kibble? ***NO***. 

Slowly, and methodically, we went through her diet, excluding things, changing proteins, the whole 9 yards. Through hills, not many she could eat as a small puppy, and PPP. Didn’t accept anything. Put toppers in her bowl, she’d eat the toppers, leave all the kibble. A glimmer of hope with enrichment toys, but ultimately lost interest almost immediately, that is unless is was wet together and stuffed into a freezable toy, which is great but I don’t always have time for a 30-45minute meal lol.

Absolute. Terrorist. Meanwhile, she continued to grow, play, and be completely normal otherwise, now a 25lb girl at 11months old. 

However, hope is on the horizon. I decided to change her brand of food, now to the third brand we’ve tried. Eukanuba adult, small bites. Super small. Super crunchy. Gave her a bowl, and I couldn’t believe it. She ate the whole bowl instantly. Another handful, gone. Next meal, same thing. Next meal, same thing. On and on. She will even ***work*** for the food and do tricks, a prospect she treated me as a mad man for with her old kibbles. 

To wrap this up, i tried an endless amount of things for appetite, investigated medical concerns, etc. I did everything I could and learned a few things along the way. 

1. Determine if your dog has an appetite or is just being picky. If your dog does not have an appetite, take them to the vet immediately. Rule out any medical concerns before going down the food rabbit hole.
2. Some dogs want to work for their food. Certain things like puzzle feeders did nothing for me, other things like wetting the food and putting it in a frozen toy worked great, but not something that is always realistic.
3. Find a food your dog likes. If your dog rejects a food immediately, they’re not likely to ever like it. It’s going to make things difficult and it’s also unfair to make a living thing hate what it eats its entire life. 
4. Unless you have a small toy dog where missing meals can be a medical concern. Don’t negotiate with a terrorist. Firm meal times. They eat when offered. And don’t progressively make meals more enticing. A smart dog will repeatedly refuse to make their meals tastier and tastier. It doesn’t always seem nice, but they will also do need to learn that you are in charge of feedings, not them.

vegpilot,Introducing dog to a second cat?,13,2024-06-03 09:47:04+00:00,"Oddly specific question, but can anyone who has had experience with introducing their dog to a second cat tell me what it was like?

My dog was initially very obsessive (possibly in a bad way) with cats, before he ever really met one up close. He always stopped in his tracks if we saw one on the street, and would not budge. He would tense up, and he has lunged at cats in windows before. 

It was mostly fine, until I found myself moving in with a partner who has a cat. I was TERRIFIED, and took the most extreme precautions. I did not want to take any chance that my dog would hurt the cat. I put up a baby gate, and also kept the cat behind a different closed door for the first few days. I let him sniff some of the cat’s belongings, but he didn’t really seem to be aware there was a cat in the house. After a few days, I let the cat roam out of the room a little. The first time my dog saw the cat from across the baby gate, he froze in his tracks. Then he started tensing up and barking. He lunged at the gate a few times. I put the cat back in the room. This continued on for two weeks, and he continued to obsess. It started seeming impossible. I lost hope. He seemed like he was going to be aggressive, and there was not going to be a chance they could live without the baby gate. I was feeding them from across the gate to associate positive things with each other. Eventually, he seemed a little calmer or less focused on the sight of the cat. After about 4 weeks, I put a leash and muzzle on him and let him sniff the cat for the first time with the gate open. It seemed okay at first, but then he started to try to chase and corner the cat. Back to square one. Somehow, though, after another week or two and another few muzzled and leashed interactions, they started to tolerate each other. The dog got used to the cat. 

Fast forward almost two years later, the dog and the cat are friends. They play, they scheme with each other to annoy us, they even sleep next to each other sometimes. It’s totally endearing and sweet, and I’ve loved having companionship for my dog. 

Now, I am exiting the relationship and losing the cat in the process. I am so attached to having the dog/cat duo that I want to get my own cat ASAP in my new place. But I am so anxious about going through that process all over again. I have no idea if it will be any easier this time. And I will not have another person to help, and the new place is smaller with less rooms for confinement. 

When we see cats on walks, he has become less obsessed with them. He will still stop and stare, but his attention is broken away from them MUCH easier than before he became friends with a cat. It used to be impossible to get him away if he noticed a cat. 


TL;DR:

Has anyone had a seemingly cat-aggressive dog slowly befriend one cat, and then introduced another cat? Was the intro process the same as the first time? Did the dog take to the second cat easier after having been around one cat, or did they treat it like a totally new experience? Did you have to start from square one?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d70l0p/introducing_dog_to_a_second_cat/

jmzahra19,Need advice on food aggressive foster dog,6,2024-06-02 17:54:36+00:00,"I'm in need of some honest advice, even if it will be tough for me to hear.

This past Tuesday, I foster-to-adopted a 75 lb male 4 year old German Shepherd/Lab mix. His previous owner died, which led him to being surrendered to the county shelter. He is 99% the perfect dog for me: instantly loyal, calm, attentive and protective of me and property. He has had no bad behavior other than two glaring exceptions: he showed very strong aggression toward my other dog, and he showed food aggression and caught me off guard and actually bit me.

I'm a bit inexperienced here: I've never owned a large dog, never owned two dogs at once, never had a food-aggressive dog who actually bit me, never adopted a dog from the shelter. I have really fallen in love with this dog, but if he is bad news, then it's better to just get on with bringing him back and try with a different dog.

More details are below if you'd like to read on, but the short question is this: should I try to work around these behaviors, or should he be going back to the shelter first thing in the morning? Please share your experiences, positive and negative. 

--------------

Original dog: Male, 15 months, 35 lbs, Vizsla mixed with a smaller breed, perhaps a beagle. He is very high energy, sweet-natured, and wants to play all the time, especially with other dogs. He needs some socialization and to be sternly but gently shown boundaries.

Both dogs are neutered.

The two dogs were running around chasing each other, and that turned into a show of dominance. My original dog immediately submitted, however the Shepherd mix took it a step further and showed strong aggression, pinning the smaller dog and grabbing his neck. I don't have enough experience to know whether this was to show the smaller (and a lot younger and more hyper) dog who is in charge (which I would be okay with) or if it was about to be a full-on attack. Also, my dog can be a bit over-dramatic, so it's hard to know whether he was actually being hurt or was just scared. There's no sign of injury, though I jumped in and separated them before it got too far.

Then last night, the Shepherd mix had something unknown in his mouth. I reached over to try and figure out what it was, and he immediately dropped it and bit me. I don't want to characterize this as an attack, it was more like a well-placed nip, but it did puncture my hand in two spots. This morning he showed the first signs of being food-aggressive. I had placed the food bowl down and was in the process of placing the water down. He came next to me, started eating, then started growling at me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d6j13o/need_advice_on_food_aggressive_foster_dog/

jesse0319,Breed Recs!,3,2024-06-02 18:31:05+00:00,"I'm not 100% set on getting a dog, just considering. If it's most recommended that I wait for now that's fine, I just wanted to explore options!

    **Introduction**
    
    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * Yes and no. I grew up with dogs but have not owned one myself as an adult. Growing up, my family had a beagle and then 4 consecutive labs.
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    * I prefer rescues, but I'm not against finding a reputable breeder!
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * Small, friendly, but independent enough to be left at home while I'm at work. It needs to get along with my cat, and be alright living in a smaller apartment, since I live in the city in LA. My cat already has sepaaration anxiety and I really don't want to deal with my dog having it, too.
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * I *was* most interested in pomeranians because they are so gosh dang cute, but I've heard they can sometimes have a high prey drive and that wouldn't be good with my cat. I love the way huskies, german shepherds, and akitas look (and I LOVE their silly personalities) but I know they wouldn't be good in a smaller apartment.
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * Basic obedience training is all I really need, but if the dog needs more I'm happy to do it.
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    * Nope, not needed!
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * I usually work 8 hours a day, and don't have the energy for walks that are multiple hours long. Other than that, I'm happy to provide whatever the dog needs!
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * See above, walks that are not multiple hours long are fine. I don't think there's any dog parks near me, and I don't drive unfortunately, but I can still walk them.
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * I will learn whatever grooming techniques necessary for the breed, and will pay for a groomer if I'm unable to do it myself.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * The smaller the better. I love big dogs, but I don't have a lot of space.
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    * Shedding is no issue, the less barking the better but a little is fine, and I'd prefer little slobber!
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    * Not super important
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    * A little of both is fine, they should at least be able to put up with me hugging them, though! :)
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    * A little of both!
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    * Somewhere in the middle, I think? I ocaassionally have friends over but it would also help my own anxiety if I knew the dog was a bit on-guard.
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    * There's a lot of people that walk their dogs in my area, so preferably not
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    * Herding (because of my cat) and digging/scratching at the floor
    
    **Lifestyle**
    
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    
    * Up to 8 hours a day, while I'm at work
    
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    
    * N/A, I live alone
    
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    
    * I have a 7y/o cat
    
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    
    * No
    
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
    
    * I rent currently, their rules are: under 25lbs, and restricted breeds are pit bulls, rottweilers, presa canario, german shepherds, huskies, malamutes, dobermans, chow chows, st. bernards, great danes, akitas, terriers (staffordshire), american bulldogs, karelian bear dogs, and any mixed breed that includes them
    
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    
    * I live in Los Angeles, CA
    
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    
    * 50F-110F
    
    **Additional Information and Questions**
    
    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
    
    * If a particular breed would be best for me, but needs a larger apartment/is on the restricted breed list I mentioned, I'd still like to hear the recommendation because I can always wait until I move to a more suitable apartment!

I think a companion and protector (i.e barking when somethings up) would be really helpful on my first time truly away from home. I currently live with three dogs so I'm not a dog parent novice. I want to get a small to medium dog preferably an adult or even a senior doggy. Before anyone says anything I'm not planning on leaving the dog for long periods of time alone and I will have proper ventilation or heating/ac device if i need to go somewhere quick. There's not a ton of room to move around but we wouldn't be in there all day anyways. I understand some shelters may not approve of this but I know there's some that do. I was wondering if anyone had any experience with living in a car with a dog. I'll also post this on vanlife to see if anyone from that community has anything to say. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d6k83u/planning_to_live_in_a_van_with_a_dog/
now-u-sashimi,My dog pees from anxiety multiple times a day.,5,2024-06-02 16:40:36+00:00,"Let me just preface this by saying that I am feeling a bit hopeless in this scenario. My little guy is 6 years old and is a chihuahua mix (maybe pug?). He is the sweetest guy but is so anxious. The peeing is frustrating, but more than that, I feel sad for him that he's so anxious.     
  
When I got him, he was about 5 months old. Someone I know had adopted him, but her other dogs were attacking him and she had to rehome. I could tell right away that he was an anxious little guy. If you went to pick him up, he peed, so we let him come to us. Every time we put his harness on to go on a walk, he peed. When someone came over to visit, he peed. On his first vet visit, the nurse picked him up and he peed on her. I addressed this with my vet and he assured me that my little guy would grow out of this.     
    
Now six years later, it's all the same. The vet says nothing is wrong with him (I was worried about his bladder at one point). He is the most spoiled and loved dog on this planet but he cowers when anyone goes to pick him up, so we don't do this anymore. I have to clean the floor multiple times a day because I take him on walks and he will pee from me putting his harness on. When he's stressed, he scratches his head with his hind leg and has a look of fear in his eyes.        
    
Just to add to this, I have another dog (a chihuahua) that I had before him and they get along incredibly well. Not sure if that's relevant information at all, but thought I'd throw that out there. I have tried CBD and it does nothing to help him. I'm at a loss. I love my little baby and it kills me that he's so stressed. Not sure if anyone can even provide any guidance on this or if it's far too late to help him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d6hdut/my_dog_pees_from_anxiety_multiple_times_a_day/
Entire_Ostrich_9652,Dog is suddenly afraid of food bowl and Kong wobbler. ,6,2024-06-02 16:42:13+00:00,"His appetite is fine. He’s hugely food driven and will eat anything at any time. I know what’s causing his fear…I just don’t know how to get over it. 

Kong wobbler: I realized sometimes the kibble will get stuck under the toy and when it crushes it it makes a bit of an unpleasant sound. And he runs away and then doesn’t want to touch it. It takes about an hour of encouragement and breaks and “paw it” commands to come even remotely close to finishing his food. 

Food bowl: it’s a metal bowl on a metal stand. One day he was super excited and ran to his bowl to eat and I wasn’t facing him so I’m not sure what exactly he did but he must have crashed into it and it made a loud sound. And now he needs to be encouraged and taken to the bowl three or four times for him to completely finish his food. 


Yes, I know I could easily get him a different bowl and not use the wobbler. But I don’t want to do that. He’s such a fearful dog he’s scared of his own shadow. This now seems like the cherry on top. To be scared of where his food comes from????? 

Any tips would be appreciated to get over these weird fears as well as general confidence building. This is really affecting our quality of life. He is afraid of literally everything and I don’t know what to do. 

Context: he was my first dog. I got him already late in his puppy hood. He was 4 months. I know I messed up and didn’t socialize him properly. But the last year or so his fear has gotten even worse and just keeps getting worse. Likely because he barely leaves the house since it’s such an unpleasant experience when he does. He’s three.

BroccoliGold4758,Alternative for dog boarding,9,2024-06-02 17:00:22+00:00,"We used to leave our dog at one of these standard places for dog boarding. She is a very zoomy lab/border collie mix and last year had TPLO surgery in one of her back knees. Since then, we've been careful to practice load management on her back legs as we believe she got hurt from zooming, running too hard, and doing sharp turns. For that reason, we have been avoiding boarding as we know they probably aren't able to give her individualized attention and control how she is allowed to play outside. So, we've been mostly traveling within driving distance and taking her with us.

Has anyone in a similar situation found a good alternative?

Weary_Hiker,Senior quality of life with BOAS,5,2024-06-02 15:51:28+00:00,"My senior girl will be 14 in July and even though she is not a flat-faced dog, she is a mixed breed and she has a few breeds in her that are prone to respiratory episodes, especially BOAS (Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome). Although she has had respiratory episodes for the past few years, I only recently figured out what it was, and her veterinarian agrees. (That's a different story and not the point of this post, just wanted to provide that for context.)

I've always known what triggered her episodes and what made them resolve, however now that I know what her respiratory episodes are, I know it's important to avoid anything that might cause her stress or too much excitement. That being said, she's not used to being home and indoors all the time. She loves walks, the beach, car rides, etc. I took her kayaking with me one time and she really seemed to enjoy it. 

My question is, for those of you who have a dog with BOAS, what can I do for her to help prevent these episodes while still allowing her to have a good quality of life? I want her to still be able to enjoy these activities while she can. I don't want her to have to spend what remains of her life indoors and without fun activities. Her veterinarian recommended calming chews and a calming collar, both of which I have now, plus she gave me tips on how to quickly cool her down in the event of an episode. She does tend to get worked up very easily, so I don't know if the calming chews and collar will be enough. I really want to take her kayaking because it won't be nearly as hot or physically strenuous, plus we can stop at the beach where she could cool off a little bit in the water. (I plan to take her during a cooler time of day.)

Any suggestions on other things I can do that will allow her to still have a good quality of life while hopefully preventing an episode?

I take him to walk for 30 min in the morning and 30 min in the evening , I even let him play with his friends , but when I try to play with him with ball he doesn't try to play I mean he used to play when he was younger but eventually he stopped. Tieing him with lease every time is not an option either as we already tried it with steel lease but he is so strong that he breaks it and runs away .Everyone is saying us to abandon my dog far away from home and I don't want to be selfish because my dog is actually causing them financial loss but I feel bad for my dog as what he will do there , what will he eat and people are more likely to kill him as he is a very destructive dog , he kills hen , I had to compensate many time . So what should I do guys how to make him stop running away from home ??",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d6ej90/how_to_stop_my_dog_from_running_away/

VeterinarianAbject23,When should I get my boy a new friend?,4,2024-06-02 11:51:24+00:00,"Hi. 

I have had my boy since 2017. Thor. I got him at the pound when he was about 12-15 weeks old and was a Chiwheenie (I think they were wrong as he has more terrier traits) according to the ACO. I had intended to only have him as I was just starting a career and new I could only deal with the one puppy. As fate would have it, my mother ended up with a 8 week old little chihuahua who she was NOT taking care of as she should and instead of getting rid of her like she wanted, I took her in about 6 months after I got Thor.

We had Valkyrie with us until 3-22-24 when I decided to let her go due to her Lymphoma. It gutted me and took me out for a solid business week. Thor initially didn't seem to notice she wasn't home, but he has since definitely noticed and has began to feel it. He has become increasingly more cuddly and unfortunately I am also going through a divorce so he lost his other mother at the same time. He is now alone when I go to work most the time (I work 8 hr overnight shifts and my ex comes by when its convenient for her) and wehn I get home he will not get out of my face with kisses and I can feel him shaking. He refuse to go outside and will run to his kennel/safe spot when I ask. I have to pick him up and walk him to the elevator and only put him down when we are in or else he runs back to the apartment as soon as his little paws hit the ground. He starts pawing at the door and scratching to get back in. I myself have only just started to come out of the depression that I have been in. 

I am wondering if I should look into getting another little one to help him. I said I wouldn't get another little pup because after losing Valkyrie I couldn't imagine having to do it again after Thor passes. I am now starting to second guess that because he is so sad and I can see it but don't know how to help. or if there is anyone with suggestions please let me know.

Alternative-Bison611,Looking for breed recs!,62,2024-06-02 01:00:25+00:00,"1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

I grew up with a weimeraner (which was intense!) and have fostered a couple of older dogs and one mutt puppy. I've also fostered a bunch of cats and kittens 

Describe your ideal dog.

Gentle, trainable, affectionate, intuitive, warm, easy going. I'm a therapist and I'd love to have a therapy dog. Or at least a dog that had that kind of temperament.  

Cool with other dogs and people, good with my two kinda crazy rescue cats. Okay with kids because my plan is to foster all different ages in the next 5-10 years.

Okay living in the city (I'm in Brooklyn). 

Medium activity level: 2-4 mile walks, probably an hour each day, longer and/or easy jogs and gentle hikes on weekends. Hanging out with my family in the back yard (in the burbs with a pool) with their dogs on weekends sometimes. I'll probably get a dog walker for the winter and summer months, but I live near the park and walk a lot. It's okay if they're not quite as active as me, or if they make me step up my game a little. But I'm not going to be a marathon runner and I'd prefer if they enjoyed walks and adventures to new places for walks with me!

I'm thinking a medium sized dog, but temperament is the most important thing to me. Ideally I'd say 10 - 35 lbs. a bigger dog that was super trainable and chill and well bred could also work (up to 60 lbs). I would be down to teach them advanced obedience and potentially do a dog sport on the weekends at the hobby level.

I plan to be with my dog a lot. If they're small, I'll take them everywhere. If not, I go out sometimes, but work from home. I chill at home a lot and go on walks. Once a week I spend a few hours in Manhattan. I plan to give my dog enrichment activities and crate train them while I'm working from home. Every few hours I'll take them out. If im every gone for more than a few hours, I'll wear them out and send them to day care or hire a dog walker and give them a kong or puzzle.

I'm cool with as much grooming as they need. 

Snuggly is great. Maybe medium snuggly bc I have a very snuggly cat. Eager to please is great, but indepdent is okay too. Gentle is the most important thing.

They have to be dog and stranger neutral or friendly bc my apartment building is full of people and dogs. Any aggression is a hard no for me. Other than that I can work with most things.

Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
Yes, but I would never leave them unsupervised.

Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? 

Breed restrictions and dogs have to be under 60 lbs. 

What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Hot in the summer, cold in the winter.

Some breeds I've considered: health tested bull dogs, Lagotto Romagnolos, Mini poodles, Poodle mixes, toy dogs, Dachshunds or and other small dog breeds like corgis at 8 weeks (to socialize early with cats), A golden or lab bred for temperament/therapy dog breeder, A mixed breed rescue adult dog with cat experience, a Well bred cocker spaniel (to avoid rage syndrome), King Charles spaniels.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d61mc1/looking_for_breed_recs/
CatpeeJasmine,Cooling Dog Vests?,15,2024-06-01 20:34:31+00:00,"I live in the desert. It's hot, it's dry, it's oppressively sunny.

I have:

* one young adult, black-coated, presumptive chihuahua mix who would happily chase real or imaginary lizards in the yard right up until the moment he flopped over of heat exhaustion. 
* one middle-aged ACD mix who is eager to get in on the action when it comes to chasing *real* lizards but who prefers to supervise this imaginary stuff. (She gets great entertainment value from it, though, and actively refuses to go inside if the little dog is still having a good time. She *will* move to the shade.)
* one kiddie pool that *is* effective for cooling. However, dog + pool + desert = muddy dog the second either one of them steps out of the pool, so I am looking for less messy alternatives to use at least some of the time. 

In that context, **has anyone tried an evaporative cooling vest on their dog(s)?** I'm pretty sure both my dogs will readily condition to wearing them (tiny dog wears a coat for winter night potty trips; ACD loves obsessively learning every damn thing), but I have questions about how non-sweating critters significantly benefit from clothing that works by evaporative cooling. I'd like at least anecdata that they seem to work before I spend my money. 

Thanks! 

PS -- Dogs go out for longer outings during early morning and late evenings. Their daytime trips out are time managed and supervised, and they have access to an air conditioned house any time they want it. Discussion of vests is purely to maximize, if possible, the time in which they can have Big Outdoor Fun (i.e., Imaginary Lizard Safari).

Maybe I’m just crazy. 

A couple of weeks ago I had to rush my 11 year old Lab to the vet because he could not get up and walk. He was given painkillers and a Librela injection (which is what I want to attribute the following events to). The vet asked me how I feel about his quality of life and I kinda broke down and mentioned how he hasn’t greeted me when I come home in a very long time. 

Redditors, I shit you not when I say that this dog has been at the door with a wagging tail every single day since then. Is it probably the Librela making him feel better? Perhaps. But also a little part of me chooses to believe that he’s showing me that he saw how much it hurt me that he wasn’t there to greet me anymore.

lifereallydobehittin,Advice on integrating resident cat and new dog? ,3,2024-06-01 19:18:57+00:00,"I have the sweetest kitty ever. She’s 10 years old, 5 lb and only has 3 legs because she was thrown out of a car window as a kitten (we rescued her and she remembers nothing and lives a lavish, happy life). She grew up in a house with 7 dogs and always had her own area that the dogs weren’t allowed in. I didn’t get her until she was around 6 years old and her previous owner said some of the dogs had bullied her so to make sure I take care of her if I ever get a dog (of course!!!). She can’t get up very high on her own. I have lots of accessible cat trees that get her about waist height and that seems to be where she’s comfortable! But she can’t jump up on counters or anything like that. She mostly sleeps and loves to cuddle and doesn’t have a fighting bone in her. 

I recently fostered a 70lb German shepherd/lab mix that totally stole my heart and I foster failed. He shows no signs of aggression at all, always more interested in me than the cat and just watches with curiosity. It’s easy to get his attention off of her. I have them separated with a gate at the door of my bedroom that has a kitty door she can get through when she wants to, but the bedroom is always for her only (until they get along, I’d love to have him in my room with us). I’ve let the kitty set the pace by having regular hang out times with me and the pup in the living room and giving them snacks on either side of the gate at the same time so they have positive associations. I was hoping she’d eventually come hang out with us on her own but it’s been almost 2 months and the kitty just doesn’t want anything to do with the dog :(. It did take her a few visits home while I was in college to finally come down and hang out with our dogs so maybe it just needs more time. 

I haven’t forced any interactions and don’t want to because I know she’s had bad experiences with dogs before and she is tiny so I’m sure a giant unfamiliar pup is super intimidating to her, but has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Is there hope that they can be friends? 

Separately, they have such similar personalities and I really think they’d love each other if she gave him a chance but she seems very happy in her little princess bedroom right now and doesn’t show any signs of wanting to venture out soon.

Even_Border_5848,How to make dog tough? (HELP),7,2024-06-01 19:42:34+00:00,"How do I make my dog tough? Like, whenever I take him out he's just so hyper fixated on the environment and scared of crowds, I want him to be more nonchalant and oblivious to his surroundings, but to still care about what I want him to do. I plan on taking him off lead in the future but he's just so interested in everything around him, he can barely focus. Inside the house, any weird noise or movement and he gets all scared of it. Vacuums are a no, among other things, he is completely terrified of. I want him to not be doing back flips over something as petty as another dog (yes... he's done a literal back flip, landing flat on his back, winding himself, over another dog passing by that didn't even LOOK at him). He pisses himself over guests coming into OUR house only (he loves people, but sometimes just gets too submissive). He's always been like this, not to mention how he's so desperate for food and will eat goose shit off of the ground (he eats like a hog inside, and no he's not fat). If there's a rabbit passing by, I want him to not care. A siren? Not care. A chunk of I don't know what on the ground? Not care. Other dogs? This is an entirely different problem for him. He goes nuts passing by them, not at all from aggression, but he's so desperate to play with them. He'll start growling like he's gonna bite their heads off, many people will back away from us (I always assumed this all because of his leash frustration). And when I took him to puppy play dates, which I did a lot of back when he was around 3-6 months old, he was always a little insecure and hated rough playing, no matter how many times we went. Same with now. People passing by, he doesn't really care. I feel like he's more of a dog's dog, exploring, rather than person orientated. People on bikes and scooters, he wants to chase them. He pulls on the lead so badly to get ahead and explore. It's like he's always so nervy and crazy about everything, like he's overcompensating for something. The weird thing is inside, he's a bit more relaxed (count out when he gets scared of some random things). I was kicking a ball around in the house and he started pissing himself over it (I have no idea why). And the second he steps outside it's like a switch gets turned on. Inside, he's somewhat interested in learning, but outside he has no interest at all in what I want him to do and he starts going crazy over the littlest things. No, this is not because he has no discipline or gets too much attention, but because he just would rather explore than anything else. I don't under exercise him, and don't starve him of attention. He's always been like this, we got him at 3 months old. Now he's almost 9 months old. He has learned some commands (sit, stay, speak, right focused heel, come, spin, jump, up - to jump onto something, down - to jump off of it) but he only does them when HE wants to, and he's lost interest in learning any more. I always wanted to do extensive training with my dog, get him to care about nothing but what I ask him to do (of course, he can still sniff around, walk ahead etc.) but you know what I mean.

mrs_shadow21345,Training aggression out of dog,2,2024-06-01 00:52:27+00:00,"Help! Need advice on aggression issues with dog

Hi, we have two dogs, two cats, and a couple box turtles that roam our backyard. We originally had one dog, but he wanted to play with other dogs so desperately that we adopted a mix breed puppy from the shelter to give him a forever best friend. We fostered the puppy for months before adopting and they got along great and we had no issues. After adopting him, the puppy began occasionally showing signs of aggression. For example, twice when I’ve been dealing with my other dog, the puppy has tried full on attacking him like dog fighting-type attacking him. He also sometimes chases our cats, which is natural instinct and something we can work with him on, but two days ago he chased one and cornered him and began trying to attack him once he was cornered. He also has tried eating/playing with/attacking one of our turtles (I’m hoping that’s just curiosity more than anything). We’re happy to continue to work with him and train him. My question to you all is this: in your experience, is aggression such as this something that’s trainable or something that we can get him to stop doing? Or are we at a point to where we need to consider rehoming him for the safety of our other pets? 

I grew up with dogs and various pets all my life and have never had one with an aggression issue. Pets are part of the family, so I’m hoping that with continued training and attention, we can fix the problem. But I’m not sure if this is something that can be trained out of him due to my lack of experience with it. 

For context, he’s about 9 months old now and a mixed breed. My other dog is a 2 year old border collie and has never been aggressive in his life, even in defense of himself with the puppy.

thatoneasianbitch0,Separation Anixety???,8,2024-06-01 02:43:15+00:00,"So backstory: My dog was adopted and was in 2 homes before ours (3rd old male golden retriever and lab mix). He was in 1 home for 3 years and was in kennel most of his life with 20 some other dogs. He was then in a foster home then sent on a home trial and after a week, they gave him back. Now, he is with us. He was adopted in November and we have recently left him with family (he’s been over there more than a handful of times and has never had a problem or minded) while we were a week away (May 3rd-10th). A few days after we got back, he started acting weird. He would whine constantly, beg to go in the bathroom while we were home just to sit there in the dark. He would pant so much and show signs of anxiety. He is a pretty clingy dog. He sits outside the shower when we’re in there and is home 8hours a day by himself due to us working. My boyfriend was on storm work and was gone Tuesday-Friday night but I was at home and went on with my daily routine. One day recently I was at work and got an alert he was barking. He was sitting at the end of our hall where our bathroom is and whining constantly, showing signs of anxiety badly. He ended up stop taking the Furbo treats (his little kibble bc I don’t wanna give him actual treats constantly) which is odd because he is food motivated. He proceeded to scratch at our blinds and ruining them. Tonight, a few hours after my boyfriend got home, we made dinner and turned on the dishwasher. I am wondering if our dishwasher stresses him out all of a sudden. Anyways, I went to the bathroom and he started whining and trying to get in after I told him to get out since I’m trying to avoid him being so close constantly. He ended up sitting in his kennel with a blanket over it. I took him on another walk, tried food puzzles (which he gives up on if he doesn’t see food and will eat a plastic/silicone food puzzle bc that’s happened but he did so some of the puzzle), then shut the dish washer off. He continued to pant a little then is now laying in the couch and has calmed down but still has panting spells.
He also always slept in our bed but last night (boyfriend wasn’t home) he slept in the kennel and had the door open but never came up into bed. 


IS THIS SEPARATION ANXIETY or DOES HE HATE US????
I have a vet appointment next week because I want to eliminate the possibility of it being a physical medical issue.

Please help.

Wrong_Comfortable205,Why is my dog acting like this?,4,2024-06-01 07:28:43+00:00,My dog (F 8months old) has been acting strange all of sudden. It’s bedtime and she usually sleeps with me and my gf in the bed but tonight all of a sudden she is jumping down and either just staring at us or going to my gf side of the bed and laying down at the end of the bed on the floor. When she stares at us she is far away and has weird posture. We did just recently lose another pet a couple days ago and it was my girlfriend’s ESA and she has taken it pretty hard. The spot she is laying on the floor is usually where our old pup use to lay when he couldn’t jump on the bed or we didn’t pick him up. She is also smelling a lot of the area on my gf side of the bed too. Is this grieving? Or is she feeling my gf emotions the past couple days? Idk her behavior is just too weird and off not to notice. Also wanted to mention we had fire alarm go off this morning and it was really loud. That was at 7AM this morning and has been fine all day until now. I was wondering if that might have something to do with it. She seems fine health wise I wouldn’t think it’s from any illnesses or psychological issues.

I live in a country with very high heat and humidity in summer. Around 28c & eighty%

My dog needs to spend around 4h on her own in the afternoons when I'm at work. 

Id like to shut her in a room with the Aircon unit but she seems to get anxious closed into one room as she's used to having free reign. Last time this happened she clawed at the door to get out. :(

When I'm out she waits by the front door. This wouldn't be a problem except there's no Aircon in the corridor and to try to Aircon the entire place is difficult.

Any advice on how I can train her to be comfortable in the living room whilst I'm out? I.e no free reign of the apartment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d5dru3/dog_heat_humidity/
Popular-Emphasis2229,What to do about humping?,3,2024-06-01 05:09:22+00:00,"Hello the last few days since summer began I've been noticing my dog hump one of his stuffed animals when he gets back from his walks. He was neutered when we got him and  hes around 3 and a half years old.
I never really noticed these behaviours or thought about them since up until now I had always been at  university when he goes to walk and the past 5 years I would help some of the bio professors with studies during the summer. Since I had never seen it before and since this was the first time my family has ever had a pet, the thought of my dog humping never really crossed my mind.
I asked my mom about it an she said that when he was younger sometimes he did it, but now he only really does it when he gets home from walks and he has been doing it more often lately, she says she just tries to redirect his attention when he does it.
My dog has never humped other dogs except for 1 or 2 times that i can think of when he was younger.
Basically im asking what exactly do I do?
Im concerned that redirecting him might be like robbing him of his sexuality, since I figure it would suck ass if someone told me I couldnt jerk off anymore.
But on the internet people seem to say that its not sexual its just cause they are excited but then some other sources claim otherwise, or that its bad habit forming.
Every once and a while ive seen my dog with erections but i always just leave him alone when that happens.
My mom said that hes only ever really humped to ""completion"" once when she was on the phone and not paying attention, she said that after he just had a long erection hanging out of his penis for a couple minutes and looked sad until it eventually retracted back into his penis.
(Not sure if these last 2 things have been relevant, just added them just in case they are)
Im just not really sure what to do.
All I know is that I want to do what best for my dog.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d5fibc/what_to_do_about_humping/

ProgramRunning,My dog chases other dogs. I'm worried she would attack them.,16,2024-06-01 08:43:54+00:00,"Hi everyone, I'm a bit embarrassed about this but I can't deal with it any more. 

My dog, a 5 year old, small 5.5kg mix (chihuahua and some other breeds we don't know), chases and tries to attack any dog she sees. If a dog is on the other side of the park, she growls, barks and tugs. Somehow she finds a way to get out of her harness and when she does, she tries to attack other dogs.  
 
She was chased by three Pitbulls when she was very young, maybe 11 months. We think this is where the issue stems from, but even before that she was scared of other dogs. From sausage dogs to rottweilers, Maltese to mastiffs. She doesn't care, they must be attacked. I feel degraded having to chase my tiny dog around the area we live in because of this. We see the same owners every day, they all hate us and for good, fair reason.

Still-Drop-2451,Dog’s ball obsession prevents me from taking her to dog parks,14,2024-06-01 10:51:12+00:00,"Some background: My dog is a small pitbull mix girl from the shelter. Got her when she was 2, she’s now 4. 
When I first got her, she was not well socialized, reactive, scared of everything and everyone. She had some training, got older + a stable home and she now behaves really well. She’s super sweet, never snaps or bites or any of that, not even when provoked. I’m really blessed in that regard.

But - there is one thing I cannot seem to control her with. As soon as she sees a ball - any kind of ball - I’ve completely lost her. She’ll chase any ball, take it ‘somewhere private’ and just chew it until it’s completely broken. If another dog comes near her, she’ll ignore that dog, and just move away with the ball. It’s like she’s in a ‘trance’ , her own world. The world could catch fire, she wouldn’t notice.

So I’m at a point where I’m not even sure why I take her to dog parks or dog beaches. She plays for 2 minutes (although she’s a real loner), then finds a tennis ball and then isolates herself for the remaining time. If I manage to separate her from the ball, there follows a sequence of desperation and crying.

I would love to play fetch with her but it’s not possible. She does not enjoy running after the ball or returning it, she just wants to chew it and be left alone.

In many occassions she will take a ball that belongs to a dog owner and won’t let it go. In some cases I can separate the ball, but usually she damages it and I end up paying for it. 

Her previous trainer said I should always get a second ball to let her drop the first one, but that does not always work and it does not solve the issue which I feel is deeper than that.

Does anyone have a similar dog and how do you handle this? Thank you!

The family loved her but wouldnt be able to give her much individual attention, so wanted to try and find her a better home.

Now, understandably, this situation is much different to an adoption, whether by a puppy or adult dog. Realistically, the dog was happy before. She had a family and companionship in other dogs, now she's in a strangers home with a bunch of cats. I can't blame her for feeling uncomfy.

Currwntly, she kind of just stays in one place in the house. Isn'ft very receptive to moving around either.

Mission-Corgi6602,Breeds Recommendation! ,2,2024-05-31 20:32:41+00:00,"1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

It will not be, I have a border collie mix currently. I also have experience with volunteering at dog shelters.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I would prefer to rescue.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

My ideal dog is a dog that I can take on long walks and hiking on the weekends, but will not destroy my apartment if they aren't walked 5 miles every day. I'd prefer quieter dogs and an intelligent breed. My ideal dog is trainable and can be friendly.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Dalmatian, Irish setters, shepherds, sight hounds!! I love unique looking dogs and medium sized leaning larger breeds. I almost prefer mutts because they are one of a kind :) 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

My border collie knows a few fancy tricks but aside the cute party trick and regular training, I value being able to have a strong recall. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Nope!

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

When I work from home, I would likely want to chill with them all day. I would probably devote myself to daily training for the basic manners. I can't see myself ever being home and not wanting to be around the dog!


8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

When I work in office I would have someone come and walk the dog during the middle of the day for at least 30 minutes. I would also walk the dog briefly in the morning and a 30+ walk in the afternoon.


9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I would prefer a dog that can get away with just being brushed every other day. If the dog had hair, I would probably do some slight maintenance cuts myself but would largely take them to the groomer for any bigger tasks. I'm not opposed to dogs with hair but I'm not enthralled at the idea.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

I prefer medium to larger!


11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding is fine. I don't mind brushing and vacuuming daily. Barking I'm not fond of (who is) but slobber is probably an outright no from me LOL


12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Very important. The area of my parents house is an acre property and I frequently go hiking; I value good recall for safety but also like to let them off leash so they can explore more.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly!


14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please! I don't mind some independence, but prefer obedient breeds.


15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

I presume most dogs would probably bark or something LOL I don't have a strong preference. I am a younger woman who lives alone, so maybe some weariness to strangers would be good.


16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Probably not.


17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Seperation anxiety. I know you can't control it but would like to stay away from breeds that are prone to it. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

If working in the office, I would have someone come and walk the dog midday. This means they would likely be left alone for maybe max 5 hours. This would be twice a week.


19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

No one but me!


20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

I have a senior border collie who lives with my parents at home. I also have 2 cats at home that are friendly with my bc and would likely try and be friendly/approach another dog.
I do not live at home but visit enough to where I would need all of them to get along!


21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Nope


22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

I rent an apartment, I will likely continue renting. I currently do not have any breed restrictions.


23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I live in the greater Philadelphia area. We do not have any dog breed bans.


24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

We experience the full seasons. Summer is typically high of mid to low 80s and winter is mid to high 30s

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

I trained/raised my border collie from a puppy, I know I will not have the time as I did back then. I still like intelligent dogs and have a bias towards sporting groups. Generally, aside from the days I am in office, I'd like my dog to become my ""hobby"" or take up a lot of my free time. I would like a breed that can go on long walks and hiking with me. But I unfortunately don't think I have the capacity to exercise a breed that requires over 2 hours of minimum exercise.

uhhhenry,[Breeds] Looking for my next apartment friendly dog ,3,2024-05-31 18:57:13+00:00,"**Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**  
No, I had a bordercollie mix for 13 years but she is in a better place now. I've looked after a lot of relatives dogs (from amstaffs to havanese)

**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**  
I'd prefer a breeder. There are no shelters in my country that I know of, vast majority of rescues are streetdogs from the balkans or spain.

**Describe your ideal dog.**  
Relatively easy to train, generally healthy dog that enjoys long walks but doesn't mind just chilling when we're not outside. Not too vocal or super clingy but still enjoys my company.

**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**  
I'm interested in eurasiers and greyhounds, both seem like a good fit personality/activitywise. And because I've seen this suggested to others, no I can't find any retired greyhounds up for adoptation. Jos joku suomalainen tietää mistä hakea niin kertokaa toki! Kasvattajiakaan ei taida olla montaa.

**What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**  
Just the basics really. I'd also like to teach the dog to run next to a bike but I imagine that would be difficult/impossible with a greyhound? It is not a dealbreaker.

**Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g., agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g., hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**  
No.

**Care Commitments**

**How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**  
Outside the walks and exercise? Maybe an hour or two, more on the weekends.

**How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly, and does that include using a dog park?**  
Depending on the weather 1.5 - 2 hours walking daily, on weekends I'd like to do longer walks and there are dog parks within a walking distance. During summer I could take them swimming once or twice a week.

**How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**  
I'm used to regural ear cleaning and brushing, I'm not against seeing a groomer every once in a while but I'd prefer not to.

**Personal Preferences**

**What size dog are you looking for?**  
Doesn't really matter but I'd prefer a dog at least bigger than your average cat.

**How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**  
Shedding and slobber I can take but too much barking will bother my neighbours.

**How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**  
Not important

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

**Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**  
Something in between

**Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**  
More eager-to-please

**How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**  
Indifferent or friendly. I don't mind barking if someone knocks on the door.

**Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**  
No.

**Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**  
I am worried about separation anxiety and excessive barking.

**Lifestyle**

**How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**  
7 - 9 hours on weekdays

**What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**  
I currently live with my mother, I know she does not like bullterriers, dalmatians or very small dogs, she hasn't given any other preferences. She would have no involvement outside of petting and hanging out, ideally I would be moving out soon anyway.

**Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**  
I have a cat.

**Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**  
Yes.

**Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**  
I rent, no restrictions

**What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**  
Finland, I don't think there are banned breeds except wolf dog hybrids

**What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**  
Summer 62°- 77°F, winter 5° - 14°F 

**Additional Information and Questions**

**Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**  
I am not getting a dog anytime soon, mid 2025 at the earliest. I lost my girl early this month and I am not ready to take another dog, however planning for the future does make me feel a little bit better.

At first I believed she was sick but after taking her somewhere we learned she's perfectly fine and is just protesting. I've tried another brand of wet food and she's also once again refusing, and after trying that specific brand again she immediately started eating.

Yanfly26,Need advice. No idea what to do.,8,2024-05-31 16:12:53+00:00,"I need to apologize in advance because I'm expecting to get some hate from this post. I've put off asking for advice for a long time but I'm honestly at a loss with what to do with my situation. I'm cutting out quite a bit of info to not make it too long.

I met my wife 7 years ago. At the time, she had a three year old rescue dog, we think he is a husky/shepherd cross. I've never had dogs, so I wasn't really sure if I was a dog person or not, but he was friendly and initially I had a good relationship with him. About a year into dating, my wife wanted to get a second dog. I was hesitant but relented. She wanted to rescue a husky/elkhound cross that we had seen. 

The two dogs have always been friendly, and I was always on the fence with how I felt about them. We tried training, although probably not as dedicated as we should have, but for the most part everything was ok for about 2-3 years. There had been a handful of issues with the older husky/shepherd destroying furniture and chewing the walls if we didn't exercise enough on a particular day, but it was manageable. I like to think I care about all living things and have tried to give them a good life, for the sake of them and my wife. I would always try to ensure they had good exercise, treats, and a good life - despite not being super enthusiastic about the commitment and stresses that come with owning two dogs. 

Two years ago, my wife and I had our first child, and this is where it has gone completely downhill for me with the dogs. The first dog as he's gotten older has turned into a nervous wreck. If I leave the house with the second dog and not him, he'll defecate on himself and trash whatever space I put him in. He can't be left alone. The second dog has always been defensive of the home and made it super hard to have guests. People are scared of him, he's a big 60lb boy. 

I've grown to resent them. Our toddler is now two and I want to take him on vacations and give him the best upbringing that I can. But I feel like the dogs stop us doing so much. I can't get anyone to look after them because most people are terrified of them - so I have to put them in a dog daycare if we travel. Where I live, the cost of this for 10 days is always around $1,800.00. We already struggle financially due to the increased cost of living, so it's meant that we can't really afford to go anywhere because boarding the dogs is almost half the cost of the trip. I have to limit sections of the house to separate the dogs from our toddler, mainly due to hygiene issues such as them licking all his toys, getting fur on everything etc - but also because I've always been terrified of one of the dogs hurting our toddler, despite them never showing aggressive tendencies to me or my wife.

Recently I found out the younger dog has cataracts and potentially is getting diabetes. The vet things if this is the case he could be blind within 18 months. He has worryingly shown some aggression in the last few days. Our older dog startled him so he bit his neck and shook his head for a second. There doesn't seem to have been any further attempts at aggression but I currently have them separated and I'm trying to monitor behaviour through a camera. 

It's all so overwhelming for two dogs which, to be honest, I've never really wanted. I always tried to do my best and care for them because I believe they deserve to have a good life, but I moreso tolerated them for the sake of my wife.

We have talked about rehoming, but finding a person prepared to take both of them together, with the issues they both have at their age, is impossible. My wife will not even consider separating them - which I don't blame her - and even giving up her dog she's had for almost 10 years will likely make her resent me and cause issues in our marriage. 

I honestly just don't know what to do. The financial and mental burden that comes with a blind dog is not something I think I can cope with. Not to mention the constant worry that as his condition progresses, he will become more unpredictable with our toddler. I don't think they can be rehomed. I can't bring myself to consider putting them down when they still have so much quality of life left. I feel like I'm on the verge of a breakdown from the stress and it doesn't seem like there's an answer. 

I don't expect to find one here. I guess just hoping that writing this out and hearing some responses might help me find what I'm looking for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d4zdhl/need_advice_no_idea_what_to_do/

When I work I'll be out 7-6 on average due to commute times, so I can't do lunchtime walks. I wasn't initially thinking about this as for generations dogs have been left home alone whilst their owners were at work all day, but some sites say dogs shouldn't be left alone for 4+ hours a day. So, I would consider using services like trustedhousesitters or borrowmydoggy. The worry with these sites is that sitters/walkers aren't getting paid, so potentially there may not be any/many people available outside of big cities.

I'm quite a homebody and would think about getting a low-energy dog. I don't currently walk for fun but I believe if I had a reason to (such as a dog) I would do this. I estimate that I socialise biweekly at weekends on average, so I do spend a lot of my time indoors. I enjoy travelling and like to go abroad a few times a year. So, I'd need a sitter/boarder.

I want a dog both for company and for routine. I see myself with both cats and dogs in the future, but I know a cat would be easier to look after in my situation. Should I wait until I'm settled in a relationship with two incomes and a house to get a dog? Or does it not matter?

For my pet food gurus, I had a question regarding the big 5 brands that meet WSAVA guidelines. I only feed Purina currently, and I’m in no way looking to switch, but someone told me that Primal Pet Foods now meet WSAVA guidelines. I’ll link what Primal Pet Food says below. (If this isn’t allowed I’ll take it down, sorry!)

Again I’m not looking to switch but I’m excited at the thought of more brands trying to meet these guidelines, even if I’m not interested in feeding raw lol. I just wanted to see if this is the real deal. I haven’t heard anything about them being WSAVA compliant until someone was recommending their food due to being so- which threw me off guard because I didn’t think they were.

FocusInevitable1504,[Breeds] Looking for recommendations for my next dog. I’ve worked with and loved many breeds and I’m curious which breeds others would be ideal for my lifestyle,5,2024-05-31 15:11:26+00:00,"**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**  
I had a Brittany for 13 years and I currently have a 7 year old bc mix and a golden retriever puppy. I’ve also owned a pet sitter company for 7 years   
**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]?**  
If I rescue, I don’t care as much about the breed so this is specifically for an ethically bred dog.  
**3) Describe your ideal dog.**  
very trainable, can hike and jump without significant limitations   
**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**  
\*I’m only going to include breeds I’ve worked with:  
GSD - beautiful, trainable, focused, one of my favorite breeds to train  
Greyhound - quiet, relaxed, beautiful, love to watch them run (nervous for my cat)  
Samoyed - beautiful, soft, intelligent, generally good temperament  
Golden - soft, intelligent, easy to socialize  
Brittany - soft, intelligent, easy to socialize  
Pom - fun sized, beautiful, generally good temperament, intelligent   
Poodle - intelligent, one of my favorite dogs to train, low shedding (unfortunately I don’t like the way they look because I think they’re otherwise an op breed for me)  
Pembroke Corgi - beautiful, trainable, soft (their fragile back removes them from being a contender for me)  
Aussie - beautiful, intelligent, trainable (perhaps too intensely energetic)  
BC - same as aussie 

  
**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**  
depends on the dog but always basic training and then I love doing tricks, agility, off-leash training   
**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**  
I love agility but I could also do rally or no sport at all  
**\*\*Care Commitments\*\***  
**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**  
A comfortable normal day for me would be 1 long walk a day and 30-minutes of play/training plus a puzzle along with a hike or beach session once a week. We’re home with the dogs 14-20 hours/day  
**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**    
see 7\^  
**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**  
my personal grooming max would be brush once a day or an occasional ear clean but I could book grooming sessions as often as necessary  
**\*\*Personal Preferences\*\***  
**10) What size dog are you looking for?**  
any but prefer not XL breeds because of short life span :(  
**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**  
medium barking is fine, pretty low slobber tolerance, and low shedding would definitely be a plus but I’m used to high shedding and all of my favorite breeds are high shedders   
**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**  
It would be super ideal. At the very least, not a breed that is notoriously a runner  
**\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\***  
**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**  
I love cuddling but at least not super aloof  
**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**  
definitely leaning towards eager to please or good training drive    
**15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**    
anything but attack on sight. Barking is fine  
**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**  
I wouldn’t prefer it and would socialize early but if something traumatic happens then I’m equipped to take care of an aggressive dog’s needs  
**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**  
taking off, heavy barking even once trained and walked, extreme stubbornness   
**\*\*Lifestyle\*\***  
**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**  
up to 8 hours consecutively and never more than 10/day  
**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**   
my boyfriend - heavily involved in walking, care, and constantly trying to get better at following my training instructions:  
same preferences as me

  
**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**  
I also have a cat  
**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**  
sometimes  
**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**  
no restrictions  
**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**  
Florida, USA no restrictions   
**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**  
summer average 85° and winter average 65° although we plan on moving to Colorado in a few years

Fit_Income8038,First time future puppy owner! ,5,2024-05-31 14:49:32+00:00,"Hi there,

So after A LOT of extremely extensive research, my family and I have decided it’s the right time for us to finally get a puppy! We have decided on a breed, and found a few breeders in our area. 

We are considering adopting from a shelter/rescue, but our only hesitation with that is, being first time dog owners, I feel like we wouldn’t know enough yet or have enough experience to be able to handle a more grown up dog with potential temperament issues. 
 
My question is, how can someone ensure that their puppy isn’t coming from a puppy mill? Is it something easy to spot? Are there any red flags to look for? Is there paperwork I should ask to see? We are planning to visit wherever the pups have been raised, and we are going to ensure the parents are on site as well, but we just want to make sure we are getting a pup from a good, ethical and healthy place. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d4xfs7/first_time_future_puppy_owner/

I live in the GCC where it’s simply too hot to walk/ do outdoor activities during the day when temperatures are at 110. She gets a 30 min walk in the morning around 7am, and a 1-2 hour walk at night. She’s still learning so during the day we do some training 2-3 times a day for ~10 minutes at a time, and we always work on training during our walks as well. I have a kong and some other treat type toys for her- but does anyone have any suggestions for games that don’t involve treats? 

She’s a calm dog and knows how to rest, she doesn’t have any destructive behaviors and sleeps most of the day, but I’m worried she’s just bored and unfulfilled. At the same time I think she understands the heat and that during the day we have downtime inside.

Should I return it or is it okay? I dnt want to make our new pupy uncomfortable. I will be gentle of course.

she suddenly seems to have bad seperation anxiety (only during the day?) she will chew on the door handle or try to dig under the door. 

i thought instead of letting her free roam the house when im at school i could put her in her crate (she actually really likes her crate and feels comfortable in it, she flew in it once on  the plane so we put a lot of work into that) its one of those crates you also use to take a dog on the plane. today i was not home and after 2 hours there was a loud thunder noise (randomly a super loud noise) on the pet camera i saw her get super scared and panicked and she kept doing everything till she escaped that crate. she start biting through the plastic of the crate till she made a big enough hole to go out of. it is really upsetting to watch. 

she was doing pretty okay in the crate while i wasnt at home :( she feels safe in there but this happend and im so scared she will now feel unsafe in her crate.. same as with the construction noises it made her scared of being alone in the house 

i dont know what i can do, im not sure if she has real seperation anxiety or if shes just scared of the house during daytime because of the construction noise.. or is she scared of all noises and if i work on that it can get better ?? im so lost if anyone had any ideas of what could help right now i would appreciate it so much!

BlackVelvetGremlin,My dog had two random fits of barking and growling,9,2024-05-31 12:02:01+00:00,"My dog hasn’t been exposed to many different things in life so far, he’s a two year old golden and we’ve lived in the same home for his life, I don’t believe we have had any major changes. However twice now when taking my dog to the elevator at night he has lost it for a few. Like, he starts growling and barking right before we get on then he just barks at me on the elevator. As soon as we get off he looks for people or animals to bark at. His hair is all risen and I should’ve looked better at his tail to see how he responded but I didn’t because I was surprised and (I am ashamed of this, embarrassed at his outburst because we could get in trouble if he’s waking people up and he also was probably startling people we walked by). I tried to console him a bit and honestly this has been a learning lesson for me I saw many responses I need to do better at because I think maybe if I sat beside him and pet him that could’ve calmed him down but I was trying to look for what could’ve caused this. The first time it happened I had headphones in so I thought maybe he heard a dog that upset him but this time it was pretty quiet. I do know he gets a bit more attentive at night when we walk outside because my husband isn’t with us but I’ve never seen it on the elevator. It could’ve also been he’s got pent up energy? I walk him twice a day and this was before his second walk but he’s super high energy maybe that’s a factor? I’m going to the vet and I might mention it. Either way I feel bad I reacted like that he is a great boy he does seem to bark for attention so he must’ve been trying to tell me something whether he wanted to play, or he really had to pee but usually he will push the button we have for that. 

Anyways sorry for the rambling has anyone had this happen and have advice? Also he’s going to the vet because I felt a bump on his ribs and maybe it’s just his ribs as my husband has said it seemed but yeah I do know I’ve been paranoid about his health since then hoping it’s nothing. 

TLDR: my dog randomly after two years started freaking out at night (occurred o my twice) on the elevator when he’s never had issues before.

But living in a place with a very high cost of living it's honestly a bit scary how much of my pay check goes to them, and I know I could be saving for a downpayment, mortgage or retirement instead of the money I spend on them. In fact, I know I should.

Just if anyone's wondering In Australia, depending on the size of your dog and !nsurance premiums etc. It's going to cost you  $400 to $700 per month, with maybe $100 less for every extra dog you add on. So $5,000 to $8,400 per year.

I have more expenses in that I pay for weekly dog training and classes, which are about $150 for 5 weeks. I also put away money for their yearly dental cleanings, emergency vet fund, and pay !nsurance.

Without this, it'd probably be $300 less but if they got sick I wouldn't be able to look after them and they'd likely have behavioral/reactivity issues.

Anyway, ik it may seem obvious and sound horrible but after working out my expenses i think I may have been better off waiting till I had my house deposit and other finances mostly in order before taking on a dog.

I earn minimum wage so for me 10k is a big difference.

Edit:

Sorry guys, there's been a bit of confusion. I only pay $70/month in pet insurance, the $400 to $700 per month was referring to the total cost of having a dog. However, it would vary depending on the size of your dog (how much food they require), health conditions, and activities or care such as doggy daycare or training. Also I should've explicitly stated this earlier but to clarify, these values are in AUD. $100 AUD is only $66USD or £52 UK Pounds. So In USD  someone in Australia would spend $266 USD  to $466 USD per month on their dog. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d4scbw/didnt_realise_how_much_of_a_financial_commitment/

throwaway665265,Talk me out of getting a doberman,6,2024-05-31 05:47:40+00:00,"First of all, I'm not about to get a dog tomorrow - it's gonna be several years until I have space in my life for a pet, at the very least. But I would love a dobie. I'm already very biased towards this breed.

So, uh, bring in everything negative that you know! Health issues, behind-the-scenes politics, teenage punk years, health issues...  Even if you had one horrible experience with your neighbour's maybe doberman maybe dachshund twenty years go, tell me all about it. I would like to be *thoroughly* talked out of getting a doberman (or any dog at all), so I don't have quite as much of rose-tinted glasses on when I inevitably pick one up.

Edit: Okay, breed questionnaire it is.

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Yep, my first. I've trained cats.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Breed-specific rescue for my first dog. I don't want to go through puppy stage with my very first dobie; I'd rather provide a home for an older dog to see if this breed is even for me.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

Smart, but not border collie levels of smart. Driven, but not malinois levels of driven. Protective, but not caucasian shepherd... you get the idea. Very trainable, kind of aloof, kind of mischievous, kind of laid back dog that's gonna be okay with being the only pet in one-human household.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

You know, I could go for a retired greyhound.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

That's a good question, because I dunno (aside from, of course, obedience/canine good citizen/temperament eval). Whatever the dog is cut out for. Nosework, agility, bikejo- actually bikejouring is probably the only mandatory one, as it's gonna be easiest for me to get his exercise in that way.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No particular plans. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I'm reeeeeally not a morning person, but I'd still have to walk in the morning. At least an hour's walk, ideally two, in the evening. Plus time for training, that's gotta be at least half an hour daily. I work full time, unfortunately. However, I'm not one to make plans on weekends, so I could put in a lot of time into the hypothetical future dog.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

Not one for dog parks. I'm an avid cyclist, though, so I could tire him out easy.

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Sure, I'm open (for doberman levels of grooming, I'm not up for combing out an afghan).

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Roughly doberman sized.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

No slobber (but I know I'm going to get some anyway). Short hair shedding is fine.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not very important, but I would want to train a bulletproof recall.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Both is good.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

You know, I once saw an obedience team at Crufts that I really loved. The dog was clearly doing its own thing, sniffing the floor, looking around, but he was still focused on the handler and following commands instantly.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Give one ceremonial bark and settle. I don't need (but would be okay with) a dog who's friendly with every stranger. I don't want (and would put in work to manage) a dog that's reactive to strangers. A reasonable level of aloof yet laidback would be perfect.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Not excited about it, but I don't want dog playdates or other dogs anyway, so not a huge deal.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Sure, a whole lot. And it's completely up to me and my training skills to avoid/manage/prevent undesired behaviours. E.g. if I don't want the dog to beg at the table, I shouldn't give out table scraps, and so on.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

That's the biggest current problem - I work at least 9 to 5, and sometimes 9 to 9. Which is why I'm not gettin a dog until I have more money and more time.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Good thing there aren't any other people to contend with.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

I have a pet rock. He's a rescue, so I have no idea about his breed, but I think he could be metamorphic. He usually comes with me, so him and hypothetical doggo wouldn't be left alone without my supervision anyway.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

I sure hope not. I'm reactive to kids myself.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

I do rent, and I'd be looking for a place that can accommodate a dog if and when I decide to get a dog.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Some breed bans on breeds that I don't want anyway, such as let's say Tosa. Anyhow, that's the second biggest problem - due to the nature of my life, I will be moving around a whole bunch. Again, I won't get a dog until I'm somewhat settled.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Who knows. I've moved twice in the last two years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d4ogzq/talk_me_out_of_getting_a_doberman/

cheeriodust,"[Breeds] Independent, family-friendly hypoallergenic breeds",20,2024-05-31 02:24:05+00:00,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I've had four dogs in my life, but none since having kids.

2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No preference.

3. Describe your ideal dog.

* Hypoallergenic, laid back, family-friendly, comfortable in New England weather, bonus: good around water

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Always liked the inca orchid, but I'd imagine getting one in New England may be a challenge. Open to any mid-size dog that fits the bill.

5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Fetch, stay, heel, ring bell for bathroom needs...the basics.

6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No

**Care Commitments**

7. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* We work from home, but life is busy.

8. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 30 minutes is the minimum we can commit to right now. I regret not taking my previous dog to the dog park for socialization. He got weird/defensive because of it (I think).

9. How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* We'd set up routine grooming as necessary. I previously had a Wheaton and did this w/o issue. 

**Personal Preferences**

10. What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium possibly large if checks all the boxes

11. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* My wife can't handle any of these. I can't handle the shedding.

12. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* This actually drove me batty with my Wheaton terrier. He was great, but off leash he'd just...go and go and go. He wouldn't stick with us, so we always had to keep him on leash. It would be great if we had a dog that stuck close. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* No preference

14. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Independence would be great, but I realize that may come with drawbacks at odds with other preferences

15. How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Would be great if the dog didn't care or calmed down easily. We don't need a grd dog nor do we want a dog that slobber/jump-attacks guests (and I realize part of this is training/individual personality). 

16. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Yes, although I'd prefer this not be the case.

17. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Separation anxiety would be an issue...we don't want to dog to stress if we need to leave it at home for up to 6 hours. It's bound to happen from time to time.

**Lifestyle**

18. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Wife and I work from home, but occasionally need to go in to the office (rarely on the same day). It's rare that we're away from the house longer than 4 hours, but we'd like to be able to do so w/o stressing about the dog. 

19. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I'm the only one who has had a dog previously. My wife isn't the biggest dog person. I expect she'll be happy to take the dog on walks, but we may need professional help for training (us and the dog). Kids are a bit young... we'll likely wait a few more years before getting a dog (if at all).

20. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We currently don't have any pets but will likely get a cat within the next 3-5 years. 

21. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes, likely ages 5 and 8 when we're ready to pull the trigger on getting a dog. 

22. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No, we own a house and are stuck in it for better or worse. Wooded lot with a nearby salt pond.

23. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Massachusetts USA - not looking for anything controversial

24. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* 78F in summer, 32F in winter

**Additional Information and Questions**

25. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* We're somewhat out in the middle of nowhere, so it would be nice if the dog helped 'protect' the kids while they play in the yard. Coyotes are around, but I don't expect them to be an issue even w/o a dog around.

26. Feel free to ask any questions below.

I feel like I'm looking for a unicorn, so feel free to give me a reality check. I'm a dog guy and would normally just go to the pound and go meet some dogs there, but I'm going to have to find that unicorn to make this work for the rest of the family. And...don't worry...if there are any doubts, we don't be doing this at all. The dog's well-being comes first and I know our limitations.

SeranaSaturniid,[Breed]Looking for second opinion on breed choice and possible alternatives,1,2024-05-31 00:47:11+00:00,"Hello, we moved into a one bedroom apartment back in October that allows dogs and I am getting serious with my research as I've been wanting a dog of my own for years now!  
We don't plan on getting the dog until my elderly childhood cat passes, and we came into some money troubles so finding a breeder has been put on hold for the moment. While I'm kinda set on a breed, I like to do as much research as possible(maybe too much) and wanna get second opinions from people who know a little more about dogs than me \^\^ While I've fallen for the breed I'm open to other options and want a dog that will fit our life style!

1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* No I grew up with a shepherd/lab mix and more recently co-cared for my brothers dachshund/yorkie mix and did most of the puppy training till my brother was in his teens. I still walked the dog 1-2 times a day for 15-20 minutes and played with her.

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

\* I'm mostly looking for a breeder as I want a predictable personality, health, and to make a good first impression on my gf who has never owned a dog. I'm not opposed to rescues if we can find the right dog, but most dogs in my area are banned and if not, too high of an energy like cattle dogs.

3)Describe your ideal dog.

\* A small-ish(15lbs+) to medium dog(under 45lbs) that is adaptable, playful, and smart. I enjoy making my dog use their brains, and while I enjoy going out for leisurely walks I want a dog I'm able to play with indoors, especially since I don't drive and there's no where within walking distance I can take my dog to play fetch on a long lead or off lead. While I know looks arent important I also like a dog with a medium or long coat. I just enjoy maintaining a pretty coat and I miss having a long haired dog.

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\*I'm very interested in the keeshonden. They seem to be everything I'm looking for, eager to please, friendly, adaptable. From what I've seen from others they are just energetic enough for my needs, can go on long hikes but also lounge when they need too. I always wanted a spitz breed and kees seem like a good beginner sptiz, and breed in general. Only thing I'm worried about is the barking, they can be real barkers from what I hear. I don't mind alert barking as long as the dog can be calmed down after a few woofs, but I'm unsure how easy it is to calm a kees down after alerting.  
I also had an interest in pomeranians but they seem more fragile which is how I found out about the keeshond.

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* The basics sit, stay, come, etc. I'm very interested in trick training as well(not the sport, just for fun). I enjoy having dogs use their brains!

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* just a companion for the moment

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* around 2 hours at the least. I work from home, and the dog will be the only animal I can actually cuddle for a while after my cat passes. My life will kinda revolve around my dog so I intend on spending a lot of time with it.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

\* between 1-2 hours, I was use to walking my brothers dog about 15-20 every 4-6 hours and planned on picking up a similar schedule but longer outings. thinking 20-30 minutes. I don't have the best physical health and we live on the third floor with no elevator so may have shorter walks on my off days. I'm happy playing indoors and want to check out a couple local dog parks for of leash play! I hope to go out for longer walks/play at the minimum once a week.

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* I'm happy to do regular grooming and take it in to professionals when needed. I also like learning new skills and have some unused/still in the box shavers I'd like to learn how to use if I get a dog with hair!

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)What size dog are you looking for?

\* a small-ish to medium size, think over 15lbs and no larger than 50lbs. I personally don't want them too small as I worry about them being too fragile for what I wanna do with the dog.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* I grew up with a double coated dog and live/ed with fluffy heavy shedding cats. I'm fine with lots of shedding!  
Barking I can handle to a point. I don't like dogs that bark for hours nonstop, but alert barking with the ability to calm down is fine and I like talky animals(live with a very talky cat atm) just don't want them to be ear piercing loud.  
I can't handle drooling at all though.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* While I want to bring the dog to off leash parks and play in my parents yard, its not important to me. I'm fine if the dog can only be on leash.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* More snuggly, don't mind a dog that wants some personal space but I like cuddling on the couch or in bed.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

\* Closer to eager to please, I'm fine with some independence though.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* Give me some alert woofs, let me know there's people here but is calm and friendly once it knows its safe/ I give it the okay.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* no, I already had to deal with one. I rather not again, especially as I wanna bring this dog out.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* not much I can think of that aren't trainable like other than high prey drive to the point of lunging on a lead, but that may be a training issue too.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* at most a couple hours every couple weeks for grocery shopping, the most would be when I'm out with family but I wouldnt leave the dog alone for more than an hour or 2 as a puppy. I work from home and a major homebody, I more worry about separation anxiety.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

\* My partner will share in the work, do at least one walk before and after work. She has no experience with dogs though so she the only requests she has is good on a lead, able to take it out with us, aka trainable and she doesn't want a dog with a wiry coat due to texture issues, doesn't want a poodle or anything with a tight curly coat for same reason.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

\* I have exotics, mostly invertebrates with plans on getting a leopard gecko in the future. We'd like to get another cat in the future as well so its important to me to have a low prey drive so that rules out greyhounds.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* no

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* We rent an apartment and plan to for awhile, has breed restrictions for most bully and mastiff breeds, gsd, huskies, malamutes, chows and akitas so that rules out a vast majority of rescues. Weight limit is 75lbs.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* I live in Michigan, my city doesn't have any last I looked.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* winter is typically between 15F-25F with summer being around 80F, with 90s at the peak over the last few years.  
I pretty much live with the AC on in the summer though.

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

\* I'm gonna be real, I'm not the most active person and have gotten lazier since moving now that I don't have a dog to walk. I'm hoping for a dog to get me out more and help with my confidence like our last one. I'm a short young women with an anxiety disorder so naturally anxious about going out alone, without my partner. Its something I'm actively working on for health reasons, and hope to have somewhat fixed by the time we get the dog(or the puppy is old enough)  
But something to keep in mind cause I wanna be realistic about this.

jumplittlemari,Is this enough activity for my dog?,3,2024-05-30 22:12:46+00:00,"I adopted a rescue around 3.5 months ago and she seems regularly bored. I’d love general opinions about whether or not this dog is getting enough activity/stimulation? I should mention that she is not destructive and does not have any damaging/destructive behaviors.

She comes from an abusive background and so far does not play at all with any toy I’ve tried. She’s timid but very sweet. She is extremely attached to me and will not walk or go with anyone else.

She is:
-6-8 years old 
-Lower energy
-26lb terrier mix (big time mutt)

This is her usual day:
-30 minute am walk 
-15-30 minute pm walk (weather and health-dependent)
-trick practice (1 minute at a time, scattered throughout day- totals maybe 10 minutes) 
-frozen snack (1 hour)
-time in the very small fenced yard hunting bugs and lizards 
-bully stick or chew (1 hour)
-cuddles to her hearts content

Despite this, she wanders and sighs and appears restless at times. 

I have a chronic illness and work full time from home, and some days she just doesn’t get any extra outdoor time and I feel guilty. I worry about whether I can give her the best life she deserves. I am working with a trainer to build her confidence and hopefully eventually be able to have her walk with a dog walker but that is not going to happen soon so in the meantime I worry.

FancyWolverine,My dog started peeing when I pick her up. Why does my dog do this now?,9,2024-05-30 20:31:54+00:00,"My dog is a three year old corgi. She’s on the small side and is roughly 20 pounds. She LOVES to be picked up. Often times, she will be jumping and pawing at my leg so that I hold her across my chest. (She likes to be tall)

But recently, she wants nothing to do with being picked up. If I hold my hands out like I usually do, she’ll run away and if approached, she gets down low and pees. She also has become a very skittish dog who runs away from fast movements of anything. And if she is walking and spots you too close to her, she runs away as well. 

The skittishness happened a few months ago and has gotten worse. But the peeing is within the last month. She’s a very well behaved dog who we have never disciplined. We don’t hit or yell. She gets love, when she rarely wants it and on her own terms. She plays well with her big brother (also a corgi) and they never fight. 

The only place she is ever without me is at the groomers. But I can’t imagine them doing something to her to traumatize her. It’s a small town groomer who we know on a first name basis.

idontknow72o,We just rescued a dog from being runover but we can't find him a new home. Is it a good to keep him if our dog is territorial? I need your honesty.,37,2024-05-30 18:50:50+00:00,"First of all, english is not my first language, sorry for any mistakes. Also on mobile

In the beginning of May we rescued a dog (German shepherd mix, 1 year old) from being run over by a car as he was running around in one of the busiest highways in our city. And we are keeping him until we find a family that is willing to adopt him. We have vaccinated him and in the processes of spaying him.

We have a dog of our own (a little Maltese mix, 3 years old), who is not fond of the new one. Actually he has been resenting quite a lot the presence of the new dog. To make matters worst the German shepherd does not like other dogs, as he is quite aggressive with other dogs.

We have divided our house in 2 to keep the peace, for now. We live in a little apartment

Now, getting a home for the German shepherd has become quite a challenge, nobody has asked for him and nobody wants him, as he is super big. Don't get me wrong he is a good boy, but woooow he HATES other dogs.

My husband has grown quite fond of the German Shepherd, as he is the one that has been the most time with the dog. I can't even take him for a walk as he is so huge and I don't have the strength to walk him. The thing is that he has been hinting that he wants to keep the dog. I  do not want to keep him as I am super scared of the damage the dog could do to my dog (the Maltese) as he is almost 3 times as big as my dog. I consider the Maltese as my son.

Living in a divided home hasn't been pleasant either.

My husband is convinced that with training the two dogs can be together, I not so much and I'm not willing to get my baby killed, the mere possibility is enough to discard that idea. But no one wants to adopt the German shepherd and I'm not throwing it to the streets, he has suffered enough.

Do you think it can be done? I need your complete and honest opinion, cause the majority of the work would be done by me, as I work from home but my husband works in an office.

Thank you for your help. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d4bclp/we_just_rescued_a_dog_from_being_runover_but_we/

mochalany,Help Us Agree On A Dog Breed,10,2024-05-30 14:49:09+00:00,"    My partner and I are planning to get a puppy soon but we're very stuck in a back and forth cycle about which breed to go for. Does anyone have any opinions or insight that might help?
    
    **Introduction**
    
    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * Yes, it will be my first dog having grown up with cats but my partner grew up with dogs in his family.
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    * We'd prefer a puppy from a breeder
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * I would like the dog to be friendly, sweet, calm, enjoy playing and going on walks but without bouncing off the walls all the time. I like the idea of an animal that doesn't need me to be the centre of its universe at all times and can enjoy relaxing at home or playing with a toy by itself as well the games, training, exercise and affection that we give it. It's very important that the dog is not aggressive to guests or strangers and not barky or defensive. My sister was attacked by a dog as a child leaving her with facial scars and it's not an option to have a dog who would be aggressive or get in the face of strangers. My partner is also interested in doing more intense exercise and training with the dog but that's not as high a priority for me.
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * We've done some research and I feel like the Eurasier sounds like it has the more quiet and gentle energy I'm looking for. I like the sound of them being a bit independent and having a bit of cat energy but my partner is worried about them being stubborn and not listening when called etc. as well as if they might be too low energy to enjoy e.g. running with him in the park. We also looked at Portuguese Water Dogs and they sound very nice (our only worry is if they might need too much exercise per day to keep sane). We find the Australian Shepherd very sweet looking too but I am definitely worried they might be too wild and rumbunctious for us. I also quite liked the sound of a Barbet but I suspect they might be hard to find. I'm open minded about other breads but I'm a bit less drawn to your classic doggy looking dog like a Lab for example (and the drool was off putting!).
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * All I really want is for the dog to follow instructions to keeop it safe (e.g. come back when called, let go of that, don't run out into the street). My partner has more ambition for training obedience and agility.
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    * I do not, my partner would like to practice some of these skills but more for fun than as a serious hobby.
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * On top of outside play and exercise we'd probably also be happy to spend another 30mins training at home as well as lots of bits of play and interaction throughout the day (but not all the time please!).
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * We're planning to do 1-1.5hrs a day in the week going on walks or to play and off-leash exercise in the park and we like to go on longer walks at the weekend which it would be lovely to take the dog on too.
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * It would be lovely to have a non-shedding dog you don't need to brush much but I'm also happy to do some fairly regular brushing if needed. I slightly dread the house being always covered in hair but it's less of a priority than other things.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * Medium, I'd prefer a little smaller (without being a toy/handbag dog) while my partner is more interested in a larger dog
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    * Shedding we can deal with, lots of barking or lots of slobber would be bigger problems.
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    * I would definitely like to trust the dog off lead but understand it will depend on his personality and history and would never do it unless we felt it was safe.
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    * Both, I like the idea of snuggling with the dog but don't want it to be on me all the time.
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    * I like the idea of a dog who wants to do it's own thing but my partner is more focused on it being eager to please.
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    * I want the dog to be friendly but not jumping up on people or barking lots. Calm but friendly would be ideal
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    * I would not like it to be aggressive at all but understand that you can never predict exactly how any breed of dog will be and all of these behaviours etc. will require some (and in some cases, a lot) of work and training.
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    * Aggression, extreme neediness and lots of barking are all things I am worried about. My partner is also worried about having a dog who is too independent and unbiddable. He also doesn't want it to be very lazy or lacking the desire to exercise.
    
    **Lifestyle**
    
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    
    * We mostly work from home and realistically there would be someone with the dog the vast majority of the time but we would also love to be able to train the dog to be happy being left alone some times when we have non-dog friendly plans as well as the odd hour or two in the day on a more regular basis.
    
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    
    * As mentioned we'd both be looking after the dog.
    
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    
    * We don't have any other pets but like the idea of maybe getting a cat and/or another dog in the future, especially if we move somewhere with a garden.
    
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    
    * Not all the time but it would be very important that they're OK with children
    
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
    
    * I own my flat and there are no restrictions.
    
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    
    * London, UK. I'm only aware of the recent Bully XL ban.
    
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    
    * Average winter day is probably 5°C and summer is probably 23°C
    
    **Additional Information and Questions**
    
    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
    
    * My inclination after doing quite a bit of research is that the Eurasier would be a great fit for us but my partner is quite worried that it won't be biddible enough/will ignore what we want it to do and also that it might be a bit lazy and not want to go running with him or come on long walks with us. Would love to have some more opinions on that as well as any suggestions for alternatives that could suit us both.

He suddenly deteriorated and had CHF. Things were finally looking better this weekend and he was eating like a champ on Monday. We had a checkup on Tuesday where the doc said he seems to be in a good stage. By end of day Tuesday, he could no longer eat, stand or breathe. I rushed him to the ER at 1am, left him overnight to keep him on oxygen and furosemide.. got a call at 8:30am today that he went into respiratory arrest and they could not revive him. I’m absolutely heartbroken. I knew we didn’t have much time left but I was hoping he could pull through. I know he is no longer suffering but I don’t know how to cope with this pain. I keep thinking I should have brought him in sooner. The vet on duty was rushing me to leave and I only had time to give him a couple kisses on the forehead.

I had my dog since I was 13 and am now 22. So she had been a part of my life for so long that I can't see how to move forward anymore. I don't sleep (unless I take the anxiety pills my doctor gave me), and as of now, I eat small meals a day - nothing compared to what I normally eat. 

I live in a very dog friendly city, so even when I try to go outside, whenever I see a dog, I just start crying. I have cried in a coffee shop, the pharmacy, on a walk home, at home, and at my doctor's appointment.

My family has hardly reached out to me which saddens me as well. Maybe they are grieving too, but I need support besides my fiancé. 

All in all. I don't know how to be a human again without my companion. 

Sometimes in high school when I was being bullied, I would stay home and just spend time with her in my room. So she got me through some tough times. And now I just feel empty.

Ancestral_Grape,Making Walks More Fun?,6,2024-05-30 13:23:28+00:00,"So I've been doing dog walking for a friend of mine for just over a year now. He's a border collie with some noise phobia that has developed into generalised fear of the dark and moderate separation anxiety, and since both owners WFH he's used to being around them most of the time. It's taken some time to build his trust but he tolerates me well now, and occasionally seems eager to engage with me and even playful once we get going. Over the last few weeks our relationship has been in a bit of a rough spot though, due to some noisy goings on in our area that have spooked him and us getting repeatedly drenched in flash downpours. With this in mind, I'd like to try and strengthen my bond with him a little more and make the walks a bit more positive again.

So far I use treats throughout the walk, with high value liver paste saved for special occasions like getting him to toilet or doing tricks. I also stop in a nearby park and do 5-10 minute training sessions using high value treats to keep his mind engaged. If the weather's nice, we'll sometimes do a scavenger hunt where I hide some treats in the grass for him to forage as well. Despite this he still seems reluctant to stop at the park for training sessions, though he becomes more engaged once I get the liver paste out. I also have a spot torch since he enjoys chasing lights (this is something he plays with at home with his owners mostly - I use this sparingly as I know this breed can be prone to developing obsessions with light sources, and it's light enough when I take him out that he doesn't really engage with it anyway.) He's not a hugely cuddly dog but does enjoy human company, quite food motivated and has seemingly enjoyed our trick training in the past, though less so in the last few months.

And so I come to you, dog people of Reddit, to ask if you can think of anything else I can do to help build a positive relationship with this dog. What can I do to make him love me as much as I love him?

2203,Can anyone explain this body language? Should these dogs be allowed to play again?,7,2024-05-30 13:16:33+00:00,"My in-laws have a 7 yo intact male BC, and I have a 1 yo male terrier who was neutered 2 months ago. Both met when my terrier was a young pup and they’ve interacted weekly since then. 

The BC has always been pretty apathetic toward other dogs; lacking in social skills, but not in a problematic way. He doesn’t know how to play with other dogs and mostly ignores them. He did issue a couple of puppy corrections when my terrier was 4 months and being a bit obnoxious, but all within a comfortable zone. 

Today we brought my terrier over as usual. Typically, the BC will do a quick sniff and ignore him in favor of human interaction and yard smells. Today, the BC was fixated on smelling my dog’s rear and was making a lot of direct eye contact with his tail up/curled. I’m fairly sure he would have humped my dog if we weren’t interrupting this. In turn, my dog was visibly keeping a distance, and when BC sniffed too long he would play bow and dart away. 

It all felt a little off and we separated them after a few minutes of this. Any thoughts on what was going on? Was it play or something more concerning? I’ve always been a bit nervous about having the two males interact so maybe I am overthinking this. Thanks!

ObjectiveRush6694,Crate advice,8,2024-05-30 03:08:08+00:00,"Hey guys! 

So we’ve had our puppy for about 6 months (she’s about to be 8 months old) and we’ve always tried to do our best with crate training. Recently, we’ve noticed that when left in the crate, she has been spitting up. It’s always clear saliva but she’s covered in it to the point where we have to wash her off or give her a bath almost every night just to get the sticky off. It’s never got any color, but she always has a spot in the crate and somehow manages to get it all over the floor around her crate. 

We’ve tried to be consistent with keeping her in the crate and giving her play time with her older sister (7F, who doesn’t have a crate.) I’m not sure if it’s because she can hear her sister in another room and is jealous that she is allowed to roam, or if she is stressed and just spitting up. 

Does anybody know what this is or what could be causing this to happen? Any advice on what we could try doing differently to stop this from happening?

Suspicious_Way1703,Renting with a Dangerous Dog?,18,2024-05-30 02:34:17+00:00,"Hi All,

Unfortunately, my dog was declared dangerous by my county/state due to an interaction with another animal and I am at a loss for where to live next. I've looked through several rental-agency/corporate leases and they all have phrasing prohibiting dangerous dogs (regardless of the cause) due to liability reasons. Has anyone here successfully rented after their dog was declared dangerous? 

The only way I see out of this is to become a homeowner myself, but I can't do that right now. It's also not feasible to pack up and move to another country.

If I can't find us housing then the only option I see is to surrender him, which essentially seems like a death sentence because very few people would want to take on the current legal implications, if a rescue would even take him in. I don't believe he deserves to die for what happened as it was something that really could have happened to anyone and it wasn't aggression-based, but the law where I live is particularly strict and now we are in this situation.

We have all fallen in love with her and how perfectly she fits in with our family and energy level. She really is the sweetest and cutest dog.

The only thing holding us back from adopting her is our concern that her energy level may drastically change once she’s been here a while, as we know it takes time for dogs to really get comfortable. We would not be able to give a high-energy dog the life it would deserve. We also know she will be adopted quickly if we don’t adopt her, and we would very much love to keep her as she is a perfect match for us.

Positive_Worry_6404,Planning a home for a pet,7,2024-05-30 10:14:47+00:00,"Hi all doglovers.

I am coming with a few basic questions and I hope to get some ideas.  
Backstory: I used to have a dog growing up and I still believe it was one of the best things about my childhood. I have always planned to adopt my own once I grow up. Now that I am almost 40, I feel I would probably be as grown up as I ever will.  
Now to the questions.

1. How to plan my day-to-day commutes with the dog. I don't drive, and in my town, dogs are not allowed in public transport (only in an actual cage. I plan to have a not-a-very-small dog, so that would make things tricky with a cage). I would have an option to frequent a summer house with a garden at my relative's place, but it is \~75min walk or 30min bike through the town. How do I get there with my dog?
2. Back in the 90s, it was not popular to go to a dog school or even visit a vet. I think we only went once our dog was older and got sick, when she was \~12 years old. How should I approach this now, register the pet at the vet, check the vaccines, and then? What are the average vet bills? I know it probably depends a lot on the country and on the dog but just curious, what people budget for that. Also, would it make sense to try dog schools/actual trainers?
3. How do you go for holidays? I cannot imagine just looking for a pet sitter on a FB group, or even leaving the dog with a relative. Find a dog hotel? Do dogs like it there, would they be sad or be busy/happy enough? Traveling with a dog is probably also not the best idea. Most places close to where I live would require a flight. I'd like to go somewhere 1-2 a year maybe.

leezrw,What would you do in this situation?,11,2024-05-30 11:28:42+00:00,"Hi, if anyone could offer me some advice please it would be greatly appreciated. So basically, my ex and I have shared our dog for almost 6 years now (co parent if you will). He stays with me and my husband for a week and then goes back for a week, and so on… you get the gist. 
He’s coming up 7 years old and my husband and I have spoke between us about how this surely can’t go on when our dog is elderly, all the running around week to week, but every time I even think about it I just get upset as I can’t imagine not seeing him. 

I have all these thoughts going through my mind like, what’s going to happen if he starts struggling to walk? Will he think I’ve gave him up and don’t want him anymore? Will he miss me? I don’t want to give him up.

I’ve not had the conversation with my ex yet but I know he won’t be willing to give him up either.

____________________________________

    **Introduction**

    1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

    * This will be our first dog on our own. We've helped raise and train family dogs before but that and some dog walking/sitting is the extent of our experiences. 
    2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

    * We'd prefer a reputable breeder but we're open to rescue

    3)	Describe your ideal dog.

    * Our ideal dog is fairly trainable, good with children, does well in apartments and is at least medium sized but preferably bigger. We love a dog that wants to play and hike and train but also knows when to cuddle. 

    4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

    * We like Australian Shepherds, Golden retrievers, Samoyeds and Bernese Mountain Dogs. We like these dogs for a variety of reasons including energy levels (excluding Berners) and velcro tendancies (excluding samoyed). We do also love the fluff. That's obviously not super important but we definitely love fluffy dogs. I also loves rottweilers (we had family rotties) and would be pushing for one if they were allowed in apartments. 

    5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

    * We'd like to train for more advanced obedience things like implied leave it's and great recall. Wed also like to have some therapy related commands if possible (something like deep pressure or orbit) but that's not 100% necessary and would be more of a bonus if it worked out. I also think cuter tricks would be fun. Like burrito, play dead, weave, etc

    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

    * I would like to do agility as exercise and a hobby but wouldn't expect to compete. I have absolutely no experience 

    **Care Commitments**

      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

    * Between the 2 adults in our house we can commit to spending virtually all of our waking hours interacting with a dog in some way and at least 3 hours a day exclusively training or playing and an additional 2 hours of walk or outside play 

    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

    * We can get outdoors for at least 2 hours a day. Most days it will probably be through walks or hikes and once or twice a week we would go to a dog friendly park but not a dog park. 

    9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

    * We are happy to brush daily for a half hour to an hour depending on how much activity our dog requires. Longer training sessions or outside play would likely lead to less time available to brush but we could commit to half an hour every day no matter what. We're open to grooming at home.

    **Personal Preferences**

    10)	What size dog are you looking for?

    * We're hoping for a larger dog but could also have a medium

    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

    * We can handle a lot of shedding, a moderate to high amount of barking and moderate drool. 

    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

    * Not something very important. It would be cool but not something we'd use often most likely. 

    **Dog Personality and Behavior**

    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

    * Snuggley for sure

    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

    * We'd prefer eager to please but we're open to more independent dogs too
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

    * We're okay with barking at knocks but ideally not going crazy barking. We'd prefer to have them greet with excitement but hesitation is also okay as long as they're able to warm up eventually. 

    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

    * We are. 

    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

    * We have cats and a small child so ideally we'd avoid a dog who doesn't like children or wants to eat cats. 

    **Lifestyle**

    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

    * The dog will very rarely be left alone as one adult is a stay at home parent and the other works from home. On the rare occasion that they are alone it would be for no more than 3 hours. 

    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

    * My partner prefers a more independent dog but has agreed a velcro dog is better for our family needs right now. They will be a primary caregiver. Our son is unable to express his preferences. He sees any dog and wants it! He would likely would prefer a dog that wouldn't lick his face if told to stop after being trained. 

    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

    * We have 2 cats. 

    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

    * Yes. We have a toddler. 

    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

    * We do rent. The dog will be an ESA and not restricted by weight requirements according to apartment policy. We'd like to keep to their regular breed restrictions though which include no Akitas, rottweilers, pittbulls, GSD, or huskies. 

    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

    * We live in Waukesha County, WI. No banned breeds that I know of

    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

    * Typical summer days are in the 80s and winter is typical in the 20s (colder with windchill) 

    **Additional Information and Questions**

    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

    * No additional information.

yolkmilk,Medium Breed suitable for Apartment? Looking for more informed advice,26,2024-05-30 02:48:40+00:00,"Introduction~
Hello! I’ve been doing research the last month to figure out what breed may be the best fit for my partner and I, we don’t want to rush into anything but we would like to be prepared and make the best decision for us and our future pet, I saw people being super helpful here so I figured I’d give it a go, any help is appreciated! 
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

We both had childhood dogs and have lived with dogs for a significant portion of our lives, this will be both our first time being primary caretakers (I have read the first time page! Super appreciated)

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

We are mostly looking at rescuing but we are open to adoption as well

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Medium sized, we are prepared to spend a lot of time and effort in training if we were to adopt a puppy and have been doing lots of research in case that’s the route we go. Our building is super pet friendly so barking is not a huge issue but tendency for reactivity is something we’d like to avoid if possible (though any dog can become reactive for many reasons I’m unsure if there are breeds that have a higher risk) We’re prepared to do multiple walks a day between the two of us and someone will almost always be at home.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

My boyfriend is a big fan of labs, I was interested in a hound but we aren’t sure about it being ok in an apartment. Most of the dogs here are mixed breeds so we aren’t being super specific. We know we do not want a shiz tzu or anything smaller than that if possible.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

We would like basic commands and to leash train, also considering crate training. we aren’t looking to go super advanced outside of basic needs and just in case commands.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

We are looking for a companion, we have both always had pets around and are looking for a highly valued addition to our family. We are excited to make frequent walks a part of our routines and become healthier alongside our pup

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

There will almost always be someone home, we are prepared to dedicate a significant amount of time each day to helping our pet have the best quality life we can. If we go the puppy route we will be spending as much time as the puppy can reasonably handle teaching each day, with an older dog we assume it will mostly be working towards establishing a routine that works for everyone. We also have a roommate who is not going to be paying for anything but is excited to spend time with the dog as well.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

We live very close to a large park, we have to go a bit further for the off leash park but we will be making daily trips to either option alongside multiple walks to keep the dog healthy and active 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

If we rescue an older dog it depends if it is ok having majority grooming done at home we want to help them be as comfortable as possible in their new environment, definitely willing to spend money but would prefer a dog with shorter hair and if we go puppy route I definitely want to make this type of care routine so they are comfortable with it being done

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium, we mostly just don’t want a small dog but don’t want a larger dog to feel cramped or anything, we have a lot of space but it’s not comparable to a house

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

We aren’t super worried about these issues as we are pretty used to this having both grown up with dogs and live in a super pet friendly building but preferably not a dog that is extreme in all of these things

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It definitely needs to be a part of the routine but we are unsure exactly how long a walk to the off leash park with a puppy or an older dog would be if they only want to walk for shorter spurts. It’s about 30 minutes on maps.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly would be lovely but not a must have

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please to some extent for training purposes 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Barking is ok but we don’t want to encourage them to be on guard with the door, jumping at people coming in will mostly likely be discouraged

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No, we won’t be having another pet in the home but there are many pets who live in the building here, they don’t need to be super playful and loving to every pet but we don’t want to cause any issues or stress

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Nothing specific comes to mind aside from very long coats, don’t think I could handle a malamute or husky coat again here

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

The apartment is seldom empty but my roommate and boyfriend are both on late schedules and sleep until mid day but I am up at 5 and home from work before noon. My boyfriend is looking to change his schedule to be able to be around more in the day but he is looking for a new job before leaving his current place of employment, best to do this before we adopt or rescue 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

My boyfriend and I are prepared to put our full time and effort for this dog , our roommate will not be helping financially but is happy to provide company and upon request other care like walks and feeding. This is our dog and our responsibility but our roommate has not had a dog before, we are going to teach him a bit more before we establish any sort of dependence in terms of care. He wants to help though

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No other pets

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No kids, our neighbours have some so they may see and hear them when leaving for walks 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We currently rent, there are no weight or breed restrictions, you can find an encyclopedia of dog breeds in this building

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Ontario, there are a few issues with bull terrier breeds but we aren’t going out of province so we couldn’t access those breeds if we wanted to 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer can get pretty humid but we have our own thermostat and are investing in a good air conditioner very soon. It doesn’t get paw burning hot except the rare bad day and Winters are pretty mild here we get like four separate days of snow a year

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

I have planned, budgeted and saved for this financially, my boyfriend and I continue to have almost daily conversations about our plans. If we are able to get a home in a few years we might look into a type one diabetic service dog but that’s an entirely different scenario to consider later down the line. I feel as if I’ve covered most things but feel free to ask for more information or clarification

Same_Literature7647,[Breeds] Help me find a breed!,13,2024-05-29 21:13:41+00:00,"    **Introduction**
    
    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * No. I grew up with dogs from the time I was born until I graduated high school. My family was  not a ""train"" the diog family other then house breaking and crate training. Although I had ""my"" dog, the dogs were always a fmaily dog.
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    * Resuce for sure. Either from a shelter or rescue
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * Ideally a dog that fits our lifestyle. we have a 13 month old little boy, and plan to have 1-2 more kids over the next 6-7 years. We also have 2 2.5 year old cats that have never been around a dog except when they were in the shelter. I work from home and we have a decent sized backyard, so plenty of time to spend with the dog, and decent area for them to exercise in. We go out on the weekends and would like to be able to take the dog with us sometimes. I do deer hunt, so a hunting dog would be nice, but not necesary. I also only hunt in the deer in the fall. Mainly a dog that would like to camp, hike, go out on a hunt with me maybe rathe then assisting in the hunting itself.
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * My wife and I like Goldens because of their teddy bear like personality. Dauchsunds were what she grew up with and we both like the size and they way they look. My dream breed would be a Blue Lacy bc of their size, and hunting prowess. However, im not sure i hunt enough to justify a ""hunting"" dog. I also like heelers for similar reasons. I grew up with a Hound/Boxer mix and my wife and I both tend to like both of those breeds. Recently a freind of ours got a King Charles Spaniel, and he seems great with their kid and a really pretty dog. 
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * Basic commands really like sit, stay, come, etc. Not really interested in tricks, mainly behaviorial things and being able to trust them not to run off if we left a door open, or wanted to hike with them off leash.
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    * Less work in hunting, and more of companionship in the outdoors. Wouldnt hurt if they could help track a wounded deer though.
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * I have the flexibility in my schedule to do an hour or two a day
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * I live in Texas, so the heat plays a factor. I have a porch they can get onto keep shaded, but woring from home, they can run in the backyard all day long. We like to take a 1.5 mile hike 3-4 times a week around the neighborhood we could take them on, and we love to hike and camp all through the year.
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * preferably little to no brushing. Our cats already shed quite a bit, that little to no shedding would be prefered. Also, being in Texas, shorter hair is probably better.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * Medium. We like dauchsunds, so small dogs arent a no, but not wanting to have something like a mastiff or great dane. Probably 50ish lbs and under.
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

xLolii,Best dog food on a budget? (Similar to pedigree pricing to kg),30,2024-05-29 19:28:58+00:00," I'm 17 currently in school and I don't have a job (canada its rough) and my mother is very stingy when it comes to money. I have 1 medium sized dog who's currently alive ( Border Collie x German Shephard x husky mix) and sadly her brother passed away 2 weeks ago at the age of 15 due to old age. My mother only results to feeding my dog pedigree and i've heard such awful things about it. I'm wondering if anybody can recommend brands that give you the same ish dollar per kg. I really want the best for my 15 year old doggy she's old but so full of energy and I want it to stay that way for as long as possible and i know feeding her garbage isnt helping prolong her life. 

Also, please no hate i'm trying to better the diet and if anybody can give me some strong points i can tell my mom on to why to stop feeding the dog pedigree i would greatly appreciate it. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d3klsc/best_dog_food_on_a_budget_similar_to_pedigree/

rroncevic,My Collie will only eat Small Breed dog food among other problems.,3,2024-05-29 04:51:11+00:00,"I have a 7 year old Havanese (Sammy) and just adopted a 13+ year old Collie (Foxy) along with a 5 year old Labrador (Raven) 3 weeks ago.

I tried various dry foods before attempting to settle on Orijen.  Raven is fine with it, but throughout the process Foxy seemed to only be willing to eat Sammy’s Purina Pro small breed dog food.  She doesn’t take it from Sammy’s dish, so I don’t believe it’s a behavioral issue.

I always add a splash of hot water when feeding and mix it up good with my hand to make the feeding more personal, getting my scent in it.  I feed them twice a day and typically add a touch of wet food one feeding and some magic dust sprinkled in for the other.  This was my way of attempting to get Foxy to eat.

Do you guys think it’s ok that I’m feeding her small breed?  From what I know Purina Pro isn’t only smaller bite size, but also different nutritional values.  Is there anything else I should be doing?

Foxy was 42lbs when I got her and I’d like to get her between 47-50lbs, as her ribs show a bit too much in my opinion.

anonparent123,Dog Recommendations for Affectionate Neurodivergent Kid? ,16,2024-05-29 08:08:37+00:00,"

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Experience with shih tzu and whippet starting as puppies, and Rhodesian Ridgeback as a senior dog. I took the shih tzu through all of the PetSmart training courses. It's been several years though, so I would rather avoid a difficult dog. 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

Probably a breeder but will also be following breed specific rescues and our local shelters. 

3) Describe your ideal dog.

Low shed (allergies), 20-40 lbs, good with kids and cats, chill around the house but happy to play outside. We have a 5yo who is very good with animals, and a neurodivergent 8yo who is much too affectionate for our cats' tastes. (We are working with him, and if we aren't positive he's ready to have a dog in the house, we won't get one.) Needs to be good with cats too. 

Hoping for something healthy. We aren't an incredibly active family beyond the kids playing in our yard, but we can give daily walks. We aren't allowed to have tall fences over 42 inches, so nothing that jumps too high. Something that wouldn't destroy the kids' plushies is also a bonus. Nothing too difficult to house-train. 

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I would love a Basenji, but I am worried that my ND 8yo might be too affectionate toward one (hugs, kisses, cuddles). I housesat a senior Basenji mix once and she was the sweetest thing. I love sighthounds, and it sounds like Basenjis are good with allergy sufferers, and are the perfect size we're looking for. A Brittany is high up on our list, as I've heard they're very gentle and would be good with cuddly kids, but I'm worried they may be too high energy for us. I've been told Bassett Hounds have better energy and are good with kids, but their long backs have me worried about health problems at a young age. Beagles sound great, but I've heard they're extra stinky? And idk if I want my house to smell like dog in addition to cats and kids lol. A Golden Retriever is a possibility, but I'm worried about shedding and size; we live in a mobile home, and while it's 1300 sqft, it has narrow hallways, and I'm worried a larger dog won't fit well. Papillons sound great, but the size has me worried it might get hurt if my kids get too rowdy (they don't typically get rowdy, but every now and then they have their moments). I enjoy Whippets, but I fear how easily they bolt out the door if you aren't careful would really stress out my kids.


5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Mostly just the basics, crate training, a strong recall would be nice but I do have experience with whippets so not completely necessary (lol). Maybe a few fun things, like spinning or bowing.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

We can devote all day to cuddling if they want to. Otherwise probably a few small training sessions throughout the day, and a moderate amount of play time in the evening. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

Probably a 20-30 minute walk every morning and evening, a small-medium sized fenced-in yard to play in, and a twice a week, hour-long park visit. We would like to start hiking and swimming more, but that would only be in the summers, and we have long winters here. Possible longboard companion in summers. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I can do brushing, ears, nails, and baths at home. I would rather not get something that needs regular trimming. 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

20-40 lbs, give or take.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Cannot do high shedding. I lived with a Whippet and Rhodesian Ridgeback at the same time and was fine with that, but cannot even visit something like a German Shepherd. Slobber is fine as long as it isn't puddles. Barking occasionally is fine as long as it isn't excessive. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

I would like it as an option just so the kids are less anxious about it, but it isn't a deal breaker.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggles, cuddles, hugs, are a must. If it loves being a kid's pillow, that's even better. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Friendly so that the neighbor kids and my nieces/nephews are safe and comfortable. Barking at first knock is fine, so long as they chill out once answered. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No, because if we ever move to a bigger place I might be interested in a second dog. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Escaping the yard

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

I'm an online student, so I'm home all day. My degree is for online work as well. It would be nice if the dog could be left alone (with cats) for up to 8 hours once a week, but accomodations can be made if not. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

We're all in agreement to what I've said above. My husband would love something a little more unique than a Retriever or Beagle, but he knows first priority is the kids. He grew up with a border collie. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

2 cats and a fishtank. One cat is chill and lazy, the other is a bully but might just need a playmate other than the lazy cat lol

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes, in addition to our 2 kids we also have nieces and nephews that they'll see about once a month. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We own the mobile home but rent the land. No pitbulls, German Shepherds, Huskies, Rottweilers, Dobermans, or Great Danes

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Montana, USA. I don't think there are any laws about that. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Winters frequently go below 0°F, but are usually closer to 20°F in the day. Summers can get above 100°F, but are usually around 90°F.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

We live away from town, and frequently make 45 minute drives. We also frequently have sleepovers at my dad's because of this, but we could make arrangements for the dog. Deer, birds, cats, and hawks, are often in our yard; it's fine if the dog chases/barks at these, I just don't want anything to get hurt (the other animals or our dog).

Beneficial-House-784,"My mother, the treat lady",46,2024-05-29 07:22:52+00:00,"This is just a vent because I’m lying awake at 2am after cleaning poop off of my bedroom floor and fuming about it.

So, my mom never had dogs at any point in her life. She loves my two dogs and completely dotes on them, but it’s a constant fight to get her to not push food on them. Usually we can reach a compromise (like me providing a treat rather than letting her give them human food). One of my dogs got oral surgery today, and she brought up how humans usually eat ice cream after oral surgery because it’s soothing on inflamed gums. I said I don’t want to give his ice cream, but that I’ll give him a homemade frozen treat (pumpkin and yogurt). She proceeds to go out and buy peanut butter frozen custard and shows up at my house with it at 9pm. I say thank you, but I don’t want to give the dogs ice cream right now, especially with my one dog having been under anesthesia earlier. She blows me off, grabs a spoon and gives the dogs a big old spoonful of custard. I cut them off, take the container and put it in the freezer. Cut to 1:45am, I wake up to the sound of liquid shit hitting the floor at high velocity because, shockingly, the fatty, rich peanut butter custard was hard on my dog’s stomach. The real kicker is that it was the dog who didn’t have surgery, she just has a sensitive stomach. I love my mom but I can’t even imagine how bad she’d be if I had kids. 

Edit: I was not expecting much response to this post and just wanted to vent my frustrations. I appreciate y’all for confirming that I’m not overreacting. I’m definitely planning on having a come-to-jesus talk with mom and will be restricting her time with the dogs until I feel like I can trust her. She’s never been great about my boundaries with the dogs, but this is the biggest overstep to date. She wasn’t happy about getting text updates every time the dog pooped or puked, but hopefully that will drive home how bad things can get when she feeds the dogs people food. 

Pup is still feeling low and puked a little bit after breakfast, but not since then. I gave her some rice and fortiflora with breakfast and plan to do so again at dinner time. I have access to a vet clinic at work, so if she’s not feeling better by tonight she’ll come to work with me tomorrow to get checked out. Thankfully my older dog who had surgery actually had no issues- the vet sent him home with some prescription bland food to minimize stomach upset from the anesthesia, and I think that helped keep him from having a bad reaction to the custard.

Filling this just made me realize if even i should get a dog coz like i will be super busy on weekdays and in vacations will be going on month long trips so if i should just abandon the plan to get a dog.

EDIT : I read some comments and people are telling me that i would not be able to take care of dog which may be correct and i am not like even 50% sure about getting a dog. So think of the question as if someone comes up to you and asks you that he wants a puppy with these characteristics so tell him which breed he should get so what would be that answer. Only the breed name no bs. Think of it as a hypothetical question ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d35gyo/should_i_even_get_a_dog_if_yes_then_which_breed/

aisha_syrup,Steak & Golden Retriever,2,2024-05-28 17:09:26+00:00,"Just have to tell a story that happened a few years ago.

One of my friends at college has a golden retriever called Oliver. Well, one day her dad decided to buy a $300 steak from a fancy organic butcher as a celebration because he just completed his degree that he had to put on hold when he was in his 20s. Her dad finished his degree when he was in his early 50s.

Her dad cooked the steak the way he wanted it. He needed to go to the bathroom while the steak rested. While he was in the bathroom, Oliver stole the steak off the counter top. It was pushed again the wall and covered with pan lid. When her dad came back from the bathroom, the steak was gone and only the pan remained with the lid nosed off. He was the only human in the house, so he checked the security cameras and sure enough Oliver was able to reach the pan by placing his paws on the counter top and reaching forward. Oliver ate it right out of the pan. 

My friend’s dad ended up getting to eat steak in Austria because her mom had booked a honeymoon trip as a gift for him graduating college. No kids on the trip. Plus her mom felt bad that the golden retriever ate the $300 steak.

Oliver was totally fine and completely unrepentant. Definitely acted innocent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d2omd4/steak_golden_retriever/

lowkeylibra,Worried about how my new job will affect my dog,16,2024-05-29 02:36:42+00:00,"I’ve been working from home the past few years, but will be going back to an in-office role that involves traveling for a few days at least once per month (potentially more during busier seasons). 

I have a small rescue dog who just turned 10 & has been my little partner in crime since I adopted her as a puppy. We’re pretty inseparable, she lays in her bed next to my desk while I work & loves coming in the car with me on coffee runs.

I’m worried about how the transition will affect her, more so the travel aspect, as she did fine prior to me working remote. We go on neighborhood walks daily & she runs off leash in my complex on potty breaks. She loves playing with other dogs so I do plan on enrolling her in doggy day care, starting with 1-2 days per week. I would be open to hiring a dog walker too.

My concern is with overnight stays. I’ve had horrible, traumatic experiences with sitters. I lost my previous dog at 8 months old under a trusted neighbor’s care (obviously an accident but the story still doesn’t add up to this day). I tried numerous Rover sitters, some were just okay, others cost me thousands in emergency vet costs. I boarded her at a nice facility during my last trip, but I hate that she has to spend her nights alone in a sterile room. 

My dog is well-trained, I can’t even recall the last time she had an accident or got into anything. You could pull her tail or steal her food & she would never snap. She’s the most gentle, loving dog, great with kids & other pets. I keep up with her hygiene, regular baths/grooming & dental care. Literally a dream dog (but I’m biased lol).

I can’t seem to find anyone I trust to watch her (no family nearby). I left her with a friend (whose dog I watched often) & she put a bark collar on her without my consent. She did it with her own dog who barked excessively, but my dog only barks when someone is at the door & I would never agree to use that. When I watch a pet, I always treat them as if they were my own, but it’s so hard to find that in sitters now. 

Any tips or suggestions for making the transition easier on my dog (including finding reputable sitters) are greatly appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d31pn0/worried_about_how_my_new_job_will_affect_my_dog/

_lanalana_,I have effectively trained my dog to do chores,40,2024-05-28 23:31:09+00:00,"When my dog was a puppy, i taught her that i wouldn’t engage in playing with her toys unless she placed said toy in my hand and let go of it. After a while i could point to a toy and ask her to “hand it to me” and she would place it in my hand and we would play

Eventually that evolved into her picking up my dropped items and giving them back to me. Occasionally she would bring me a bit of paper or something she found on the floor and i would get super excited and give her treats. 

Now its evolved even further and whenever my dog wants a treat she wanders around the house until she finds a loose sock or bit of trash or a dropped towel. 

I have quite literally trained my dog to clean up around the house. Next step is teaching her to put her own toys back into the basket ig",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d2xyu5/i_have_effectively_trained_my_dog_to_do_chores/
TrveImmortality,Breed recommendations for apartment living,7,2024-05-28 22:56:05+00:00,"**Introduction**

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

A reputable breeder.

A companion that can chill during the day and go on a longer walk once a day.  I work remotely full time, so the dog would rarely be left alone.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I was primarily interested in Cavaliers, but I got discouraged by their health issues, particularly [this post](https://www.peta.org.uk/blog/cavalier-king-charles-spaniels-health/) by PETA. Not sure how valid that is, but would rather stay away from brachycephalic breeds because of that.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

It has to be comfortable in a car, longer trips would be rare but could happen. Walking without a leash would be a huge plus.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

Taking walks - up to an hour each day. I live in the suburbs and there's a lot of hilly forests nearby which is a nice area to have walks. A dog park visit would be possible at least once per week.

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I don't mind brushing and nail clipping at home. For trimming I would rather pay a professional to do it every once in a while.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Small and medium sized.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Moderate amount of shedding should be fine. Lower amount of barking preferred but not a deal-breaker.

It's quite important.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

A snuggly dog, as long as it still allows me to work during the day.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager-to-please.

No.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

The responsibility and time spent with the dog will be shared with my SO.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Not regularly. I do have smaller kids in the family though.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

I rent an apartment, the dog can't be too destructive to the furniture and other equipment, otherwise no restrictions.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Poland.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

xAetheri,[Breeds] Can a very high energy breed be happy with my apartment/schedule?,15,2024-05-28 22:16:05+00:00,"**1)**	**Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

* This will be my first time raising a dog completely by myself, but I've been around dogs (helped train and care for Bichons, a Poodle, and later Doodle mixes in my family, and I've dogsat a Husky, a Pom, and a Shiba Inu).

**2)**	**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**

* I want to rescue, but I do have some concerns as I have two cats and I am a bit worried about the unpredictability of a shelter dog. I'm also considering trying to adopt a retired show or breeding dog instead of a puppy.

**3)**	**Describe your ideal dog.**

* I would love to take my dog out for around 3-4 hours every weekday for walks, jogs, short hikes, frisbee, training, etc. On weekends I'm hoping to take my dog on long hikes and places where they can really run and stretch off-leash. I also want to take weekly classes in either agility or disc sports. I am looking for a dog that is highly eager to please, and essentially becomes my second shadow. A little goofy/crazy (not neurotic). I'd like this dog to mostly take over my life, aside from my cats. 

**4)**	**What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

* Silken Windhounds seem to fit the ""bundle of energy but also a couch potato"" bill, while also being a bit more biddable and better off leash than a greyhound.
* Dalmatians have come up quite a lot, though I don't yet know much about them.
* Herding breeds like the Belgian/Swiss/Dutch/etc. Shepherd/Border Collies/Mudi have come up a lot, especially for sports and obedience.
   * I really love Belgian Shepherds (all 4) but I see some mixed experiences as to how much is really efficient physical/mental stimulation for them. I am aware of their mouthiness, the extreme needs, the 2-year old on cocaine aspects. I am ok with this, but feel free to let me know if my answers tell you I can't feasibly provide for them.
* I've also been looking at Smooth/Rough Collies recently and they seem like they might be a bit milder once it's time to relax.

**5)**	**What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

* Advanced obedience, disc catching or frisbee (maybe up to the dog?), recall, fun tricks.

**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**

* Not really. I want to take proper lessons/classes on a weekly basis, but don't think I want to compete.

*Care Commitments*

**7)  How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

* Training: around 1 hour a day, split into 2-3 sessions
* Playing: 1 hour or so of fetch/frisbee outdoors. Incase dog parks are not a possibility, I have also looked into rentable fenced in areas that I might be able to use daily in the mornings. I found a site called Sniffspot that seems like it might work as a way to ""rent a yard"" for an hour everyday. Also another 30\~60min playing at home.
* Walking/Jogging: at least 2-3 hours a day. Those may all need to be on leash though, as the off-leash parks and trails would be a bit outside the city.
* For when I'm not home, I'd like to either take the dog to doggy daycare or have a walker come. I think this depends on the breed/individual dog, as I know some of these breeds tend to do better than others.
* If I go the dog walker route, or even just when I'm home but busy, I plan to have a lot of snuff matts and puzzles, and chew toys to rotate around. If I have a dog walker come I'd have them rotate something new in when they leave.

**8)  How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

see above

**9)   How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

* I clean ears eyes and teeth everyday for my cats, so I'd do the same for my pup. If there's anything I feel uncomfortable with then I'll happily leave it to a professional.

*Personal Preferences*

**10)**	**What size dog are you looking for?**

* Medium to Large. I'm thinking 45-90 lbs.

**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

* Shedding/extra grooming is fine; not keen on slobber. Occasional barks when someone rings the doorbell or when I get home should be fine, but excessive barking may cause issues with the neighbors.

**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

* Very important.

*Dog Personality and Behavior*

**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

* Snuggly is a big plus, but not a necessity.

**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

* Very eager to please.

**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

* This doesn't really matter to me.

**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

* Preferably no. I am happy to pass on dog parks and doggy daycare but living in the city there will always be dogs coming up to us and it's not very avoidable.

**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

* I think this is implied already but just concerns with the cats.

*Lifestyle*

**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

* 4-5 days a week for about 7-8 hours a day. I likely can run home to walk the dog during lunch. If not then a dogwalker or daycare.
* I'm aware highly active breeds can do ok in an apartment but wondering if the apartment + time alone is too much.

**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

* It's just me.

**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**

* 2 Cats, (Bengals).

**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

* No.

**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

* I will rent. I'm willing to deal with the inconvenience and I won't be moving in unless the breeds I'm interested in are all given an OK.

**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

* I'd like to be in Chicago or Boston in 2025, which both have none right now.

**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

* Winter low of 22°F to a summer high of 82°F.

VTGrown,Breeder/kennel recommendations for a started Labrador!,7,2024-05-28 18:09:20+00:00,"I am looking for recommendations for a breeder or kennel to get a started Labrador retriever. I am a semi-experienced dog owner having had one dog as an adult and grew up with dogs in the house throughout my youth. My prior dog was a Labrador mix (Labrador/ Rottweiler/German Shepherd/sporting dog not otherwise specified) that I had for over 13 years before he had to be put down. The primary role of this dog would be a companion / family pet with some possible infrequent waterfowl hunting usage. I have a 3-year-old daughter at home approximately 50% of the time and otherwise have an active lifestyle with running, hiking, backpacking, canoeing, etc. I would love to find a good all-around dog with an ideal full-grown weight between 55-65 pounds and a good temperament for a wide variety of activities. Additionally, I work overnight shifts 3 nights a week and would hopefully find a dog that doesn’t go bonkers during the daytime on those days. Within reason, cost is not much of an issue nor is the location of the breeder. Ideally, I would find a dog that is early through mid-adolescence, housebroken, and has good basic obedience and socialization. I would be willing to travel to receive familiarization training for myself as well.

Far_Refuse516,[Breeds] Looking for a smallish semi-independent but loyal apartment dog - is there one?,18,2024-05-28 18:14:24+00:00,"Hey, could you help me identify if there is a dog which would suit with my current environment and lifestyle? Thank you!

**Introduction**

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

It will be my first, I've never owned a dog before.

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder)?

I'm leaning towards finding a good breeder, to get as much info as possible about the background of the dog (including health) and be able to ask the breeder for advice as well in case needed in raising the dog.

3) Describe your ideal dog.

A moderately active companion, social and loyal to me. With a generally 'interested in life and things' disposition, likes activities, going on walks and the occasional forest stroll. But should also be able to relax at home. Trainable, but I don't mind them having a bit of a stubborn personality. Smallish, because I live in an apartment. Should be trainable to be alone some part of the day.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I've been looking at the wire-haired dachsund (standard or mini), because I think I would like their temperament. Appearance-wise I like wire-haired or similar dogs - with a bit of a 'rough' look, not too sweet. I've also thought of the miniature schnauzer and the west highland white terrier, however I think westies are a bit too cute for my taste.

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic training like sitting, walking, maybe rolling over etc. I'm more interested in offering the dog intellectual activity and excitement, rather than teaching them to do tricks just for the sake of it. I'd like to buy them interesting puzzle-like toys and take them on walks to interesting places and let them sniff around.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No competing nor working.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

1-2 hours, more on weekends (longer walks etc). I'd like to take my dog with me to places, sometimes to work or to events or cafes where dogs are aloud (but which wouldn't be too busy and stressful for the dog, I'd be mindful of that).

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

1-1,5 hours of walking total on weekdays (2-4 separate walks I think). Also I would play with them with toys either indoors or outdoors during the walk or in the small garden of my apartment building. I would occasionally also visit a dog park which is near. I wouldn't mind socializing them with other dogs.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I'm thinking I could brush once a week, as well as do other smaller necessary grooming like clipping nails, cleaning ears etc. If needed, I would be willing to pay a professional, but not too often. A dog needing very frequent/extensive hair grooming would not be for me.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Small or smaller medium.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding - little to moderately. Barking - better less because of the apartment thing, however I know that dachshunds which I've been looking at tend to bark. Slobber - less is better.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It would be cool to let them loose on a forest walk and I'd be willing to do extra training for that, but not a dealbreaker if can't do it.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I would like if they generally wanted to hang close to me, but they don't have to be attached to me all the time.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

A healthy mix of both.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Some initial barking would be okay. Definitely wouldn't want them to be aggressive. I'd like them to be generally friendly, but they don't have to be all over every stranger from the first moment. It's fine though also if they are really friendly, since they wouldn't be a guarding dog.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Since I'd like a smaller dog, then I think a little bit of agression I could handle, but not too much really. I'd like to socialize and train them from the beginning to be okay with other dogs.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Excessive chewing or scratching or destroying furniture would be a problem (some is inevitable however probably). But a bigger chewing/destroying problem should be able to be prevented with training, I hope.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Daily, since I live alone and work a 9-5, but my work is flexible and I would work out a plan with a mix of days in a week: on some days taking the dog to work with me (office type job), on some days working the morning from home and going to the office after lunch (dog is alone at home for 6 hours), on some days vice versa. About 1 day/week would be full home office.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

No other people besides me in my home. I would however make agreements with atleast 3 other people who could dog-sit when necessary.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

No other pets.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Not children, but there are many teenagers ages 16+ where I work. There might be moments of interaction and definitely passing by some groups of people, but I wouldn't let the teens play with the dog necessarily, atleast not in large amounts.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

I am currently renting. To get the dog, I would either make an agreement with my current landlord or move to another apartment where dogs are aloud.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Europe. I don't think any breeds are banned in my country, but if there are, these would be breeds I probably wouldn't want to have anyway (agressive breeds, breeds with extreme health issues).

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer: 27°C/77°F, winter: -15°C/5°F. Does sway either way.

Additional Information and Questions

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

No additional information.

iiitff,Breed Recommendation,8,2024-05-28 17:45:19+00:00,"\*\*Introduction\*\*



1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?



\* Yes, first owned dog. I have been very involved in training the family dogs (stabijhoun, spaniel mix) though, as well as experience working with sled dogs and now living with a mini dachshund and a labrador.



2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?



\* Breeder



3)	Describe your ideal dog.



\* A fun and adaptable companion that I can take many places and try out lots of things with. 



4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?



\* So many different ones lol. For a medium sized dog: smooth collie, german pinscher, english springer spaniel, boykin spaniel (wish they were available), viszla (if I go for a high energy dog), field spaniel, Drentse patrijshond, and open for any suggestions

For a small dog: (English) cocker spaniel, english toy terrier, manchester terrier, miniature pinscher, danish swedish farmdog (this one's a safe bet)



5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?



\* Anything needed to be a good companion, being off leash ideally, bikejoring and skijoring, and I love trick training 



6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?



\* No



\*\*Care Commitments\*\*



  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?



\* 1-2 hours probably?



8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  



\* 1-2 hours. Leash walks, sniffy walks, long line walk in the forest, skijoring and bikejoring on weekends and holidays. No plans on doing dog parks.



9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?



\* I want very low grooming needs



\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*



10)	What size dog are you looking for?



\* I know I want a medium sized dog, 15-20 kgs ideally. I may potentially consider a small dog as a second dog in the future, so open for small (3+ kg) dog breed suggestions too.



11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?



\* I prefer shedding over grooming, but after living with a labrador I definitely want less shedding than that. I don't want a very barky dog but I'm fine with alert barking as long as it's accurate and not excessive. I prefer little to no slobber.



12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?



\* Not a dealbreaker if it's not something I can do but I would prefer to be able to train the dog to be off leash.



\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*



13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?



\* Snuggly dog



14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?



\* I'm fine with eager to please or a little stubborn, but not primitive level independent.



15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  



\* Ideally: Barking when someone is coming, but rather no bark than aggressive behaviour/extreme barking. Neutral to strangers and happy to see visitors, but again rather a friendly dog than aggressive one.



16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?



\* Yes, but really prefer not to.



17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?



\*A dog that does not want to go on long walks

\* A ""heartbreak breed"" in terms of health issues

\* Resource guarding. 



\*\*Lifestyle\*\*



18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?



\* For a full workday 



19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 



\* I live alone



20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?



\* I plan to have cat(s). I also may get a second small dog in the future.



21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?



\* I do not plan on having children, but the dog should be able to tolerate (respectful) children without a problem



22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?



\* -



23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?



\* I live in Norway, there are banned breeds but none that I would have any interest in owning



24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?



\* 25C -15C



\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*



25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.



\* No additional information.

Any-Art-5671,Gf wants me to rehome my pup,92,2024-05-28 17:05:08+00:00,"Me and my gf dated for a few months when I decided to get a puppy. The puppy was great but quickly became a lot more work than either of us were expecting. She has her own two cats so the puppy was my responsibility. I have had the puppy for about 7 months now and my gf really does not like the dog. She does not like that the puppy jumps on her and barks when she wants attention, it is also a problem with how much of my time the dog takes up. Its strange because she is a total dog person and had a bunch growing up but now just has cats. She wants me to think really hard about rehoming of the pup, not for her but because the dog does cause me a lot of stress. I also work from home everyday and have built an incredible bond with my dog. My gf is the love of my life and I don't want to loose her either, im not sure what to do. She would never give me an ultimatum but we have talked and she basically said this could never work with your dog and my two cats while we both cried our eyes out not knowing what to do. I signed the dog up for an expensive board and train in hopes her being well behaved around my gf will help.

RevolutionaryBuy5282,What “dogs are so gullible” hack have you used to train your dog?,494,2024-05-28 17:12:31+00:00,"My two pups may be part basset, but they still haven’t sniffed out my BS. Things that have worked:

- Verbally disciplining the vacuum (less scared of it)
- Regular kibble on the snuffle mat (eats full serving instead of grazing)
- Putting the kibble bowl in a cold oven for 30sec (picky eaters)
- Running in the opposite direction if they won’t immediately recall

While not a blatant con like the above examples, I like to put on Oscar-worthy performances. Like acting as if they won Olympic gold after learning a new trick or potty training.

Ok_Highway_5974,Will my adopted dog ever show affection?,13,2024-05-28 08:16:53+00:00,"I adopted a street dog from Thailand, although she’d never lived on the streets, she’d lived in a really nice rescue over there for nearly a year. 

I’ve had her a little over 2 months, and I’m really not finding it very rewarding right now. 

When I imagined having a dog, I imagined long walks in the countryside and having a loving affectionate companion in my flat.

However neither of those are happening at the moment. She gets too overstimulated and frustrated on lead for more than a 20-30 minute walk round my neighbourhood. (Which I do several times a day). Sometimes I take her to a private dog field for an hour’s run off lead.

And she’s really not affectionate either. The most she gives is a quick face kiss first thing in the morning when I let her out her crate. Occasionally she wags her tail when I speak to her. She seems to enjoy a shoulder scratch. But apart from that, she won’t want to cuddle and won’t show any affection at all. She is food obsessed and gets fixated on any and all food.

I understand I probably need more patience. But I’ve heard of loads of fellow adopters whose dogs immediately love them, and I don’t think mine gives a toss about me, as long as she’s getting fed. I’m just finding it so hard and to be honest I am regretting the decision some days.

The first two were a breeze to house train. The Aussie is driving me nuts. It's like he isn't trying to use his two brain cells.


I take him out hourly, he plays with the other two. As soon as he pees or poops outside, I give him a treat. He spends the night in a crate for now (doesn't mind it at all) and I take him out to do his business when he asks. A treat after he does it.


But he still randomly leaves puddles and poops inside the house. Worse, if I catch him squatting and take him out, he just sits there. And as soon as we go back in, he does his business inside 😖

What can I do?? The other two girls caught on so quick, same method. I must be missing something?

Hey! Just curious cuz I know a lot of dogs do this. They take a big ole drink and walk away from the bowl with water still spilling from their mouth 😹

A few days ago I tried putting a couple paper towels down to reduce the wetness. It worked for a bit and did last a couple days but I am curious if anyone out there has other solutions they’ve tried.

It’s not much work to clean it up but it would be nice to have an ongoing way of preventing water from getting on the floor around the bowl. 

My water bowl came with a small plastic mat but it always ends up with the underside completely soaked. Aside from the slight ick, it’s mostly about stopping mould from gathering or any structural damage from excessive water.

Most people probably don’t do anything about it but I bet there’s a few out there who have come up with some creative ways of dealing with this. Curious to hear your responses!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d2jx09/tiptricks_for_water_bowl_splash/

clonazepam-dreams,Anyone had a bad experience with a rescue company?,15,2024-05-28 16:04:44+00:00,"I was considering buying a dog from a breeder but then came across so many dogs in need of adoption. 

I found one dog in need that I thought would suit me and my husband’s lifestyle. The dog was 1 year old, house and crate trained. Needed some help with socialization with other people (very scared on walks on the leash) but does well in its foster home with other dogs. That’s what its bio stated. 

I went through a vigorous application. Sent in intro videos of myself, husband and my home. References were emailed and answered their questions. 

Then right before the meet and greets (1 virtual and the other physical) I was told the foster mom would be going on vacation and the dog would be moving into a new home immediately. 

This set off alarm bells because the dog is moving into a new home a week before moving into my home. It’s going to have double of a hard time adjusting to me. 

I would no longer get to ask the original foster mom all my questions about the dog!

I emailed the rescue company and they only told me now that the dog has protective issues and is too protective of the foster mom so my questions for the mom on the dogs personality / behaviour won’t matter because the dog is too attached. 

Apparently the dog is going to a new foster mom that’s a trainer and behaviouralist and the rescue is still saying I can adopt the dog next week depending on what this new foster mom has to say about the dogs behaviour. 

I am so heartbroken and in complete shock that this is how a rescue would operate. Is this normal? I have such a bad taste in my mouth that they hid the dogs possessiveness of the owner and are just dumping around the dog. That they wanted me to take a dog that’s going through big changes and dump that on me.

Renrie_,should i as a dog sitter help train the dog? ,28,2024-05-28 15:15:34+00:00,"Hey guys, i need your opinion on something - please hear me out im really conflicted about the situation.

Im a dog sitter (part-time next to uni) and i offer 1:1 care - going for walks, taking care of dogs at their home/at my home for afternoon/overnight/weekly stays. But i do not offer training sessions. One of the reason is that i dont have a trainer license.

A guy interested in my services wrote me an e-mail.

* He has an Amstaff puppy (7 months) for 2 months
* And he has experience with shelter dogs but his current puppy is a mystery to him
* the puppy has huge seperation anxiety (destroyed part of the floor at the door when he left) and also pulls toward other people, pulls the leash, etc. whenever they are outside ^((I'd say normal puppy behavior that you can train; though i havent seen the puppy yet))
* Puppy doesnt like other dogs and seems to be coming from a puppy mill - rescued
* Puppy is good with children, and all that at home, but not outside ^((again: normal untrained dog, missing different training scenarios))
* He also told me he is overwhelmed with the puppy since his gf went back to work, one reason is that due to illness he is recovering from
* He is currently searching for a dog trainer but he also said that he doesnt have much money rn - though he has asked my rate ^((havent given him any bc i dont have a rate for training))
* ""I would call it an exchange of experiences, as you seem to have done a lot with dogs.""
* to the guy: he is fully covered in tattoos (torso up to his head and arms), which is not usually seen in my city, so i was a bit taken aback when i saw his profile.

Why im not sure if i should do it:

* i dont offer training courses, though i do some (light) training with the dogs when the dog is in my care for several days (for enrichment)
* im probably judging him by the guys looks
* the dog is very cute, and could become a regular at some point?? maybe
* i do offer a ""care package"" at the owner's place - but normally when they are not here and i just do whatever (specially seperation anxiety), and if the owners want, i go for a walk with the dog. So it would be similar
* its actually just talking with the guy giving some tips overall?? which i do anyway though less promted (more in situations that call for it)
* i could take a look at least??
* he is anyway trying to find a dog trainer but i wouldnt like it if he heavily depended on me
* should i give him my normal dog sitting rate (9€/h) + training fees??????

idk guys pls help me come to a decision, i dont want to ghost the guy.

  
---

Update/Edit:

Thanks for everyone who commented and helped me reach a decision -  I declined on the guy. I read through all the comments and re-evaluated what service i want to give the community and currently it is still dog sitting + reinforcing their training (as many of you said) but no training sessions with the owners.

Regarding the trainers license: I plan on getting it at one point in the future but currently it would be too much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d2lxai/should_i_as_a_dog_sitter_help_train_the_dog/

slizzard3690,New dog adoption anxiety,15,2024-05-28 14:09:05+00:00,"Hi all,

I just adopted a new dog Friday. 2 years old, about 13 pounds, some kind of cute little white mix. He's honestly a dream. A little shy at first, but so sweet and smart. Was probably dumped by his previous owners and was found with burrs embedded all over him. I however have been a ball of anxiety and worry. I'm a good dog owner, my previous dog passed away 3 years ago at 14 and I wasn't sure I was ever going to get another dog, but here we are. I actually adopted him from my previous vet's office. I'm worried about being too boring, being gone during the day for work, evacuations (I live in Louisiana). Not to mention my bf and I broke up Thursday night, so its just a lot ALL RIGHT NOW. He seems super happy and does already really like me a lot and does a lot of snuggling and listens super well. I know this type of anxiety is common. I suppose I'm just looking to vent and maybe get some reassurance.

I’ve tried ropes, balls, stuffed toys, but nothing works. Even while playing with other dogs, whenever they chase balls, he just chases and run alongside them, clueless that they are excited about the toy itself.

Strange-Ad-1458,I don’t know how to entertain my dog…,17,2024-05-27 21:34:09+00:00,"I have three whippets (4 till about two weeks ago) and one of them needs lots of stimulation. 

She loves long walks, but even some days after a four hour walk up a mountainside she can get bored. She is not at all food driven so food toys/games are no use. She is also clever enough to understand when a command is “pointless” and therefore will ignore it (eg. If we are out walking and call her to come back to us because she has gone far ahead, she will simply wait for us to catch up. If we click the lead to show her he need her all the way back so we can get her on the lead, she will usually come all the way back though, as we have given her a reason to put in the effort). She is happy to sleep a lot (she is a whippet after all), but is definitely more active and needs more stimulation than any other full whippet I have met. 

It has become more apparent though recently as before she would go play with her brother (we had litter siblings and they definitely looked after each other), he recently died because of a heart condition, and now she is even more easily bored. She does not complain much, but is so excited when we say we are going for a walk. 

It is obvious she needs more stimulation but I don’t know what I can do as food is of no interest, neither are lures (again she can tell they are no alive so sees no point in chasing them), and training is difficult as she both sees no point and is not food driven. 

Any ideas on how I can help her?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d22yfp/i_dont_know_how_to_entertain_my_dog/

So my parents chose to put our sweet baby down today, she was 14 and half years old and she was paralyzed in the back limbs for the past 7 years due to ivdd (she had surgery but her spine did not recover). My father made so much sacrifices for her always taking the most care of her, only my father knew how to make her pee manually as she was paralyzed.

Tekki777,I lost my dog over the week and I feel empty,70,2024-05-25 20:27:31+00:00,"We had to say goodbye to my Abby on Thursday. She was 11 and dealing with kidney failure. I spent the week caring for her, watching her deteriorate and I couldn't be there to say goodbye. It was too much for me.

She was a really sweet Beagle/German Shepherd mix and was such a sweet girl. She was very subdued, always skittish, anxious, and not the most playful dog I've had, but fucking hell she was such a good gurl. I've never had a dog who had the sassiest zoomies I've ever seen. Hell, I didn't know what zoomies were until we adopted her. I don't think I've ever met a dog who would just flop down and roll in the snow. For a while, walking her in the winter was exciting because I used to watch her play in the snow.

I wish we could've done more for her. Having her made me realize that despite growing up with dogs, I have no idea how to handle one. I don't think anyone in my family does. There wasn't anything we could've done for the renal failure, but I wish we could've figured out how to get her out of her shell more over the past 9 years we had her. Maybe I'm overthinking, but I always felt she was lonely at times. We got her when she was 2 from a crappy shelter that was later shut down for how terrible the conditions were and they got her from down in South Carolina. I knew she was a mother before we adopted her but I never knew what she went through in SC. Despite all that, she really loved us.

She's the fourth pet we've lost over the past five years and just last year I had to suddenly say goodbye to my childhood cat. For some reason I took losing her better than now. I don't know, maybe its because I legitimately did all I could with her. Maybe because it happened so suddenly in one day compared to almost a week. Maybe it's shitty for me to compare notes, I don't know. My dog is gone. She'll never follow me around after I leave her room once I thought she was comfortable in her bed. She'll never walk in our living room mooching for food.

I can't walk into her old room. I can't walk to her old bed. I can't toss her old food and water. Almost everything dog related reminds me of her. I'm just fucking devastated. I have a dog shaped hole in my heart and I honestly don't think I can take care of another one responsibly. Not at this point in my life.

Abby, I fucking love you. You were such a good girl.

**Edit**: 

I'm writing this here because I'll be here all night thanking you guys, lol.

Thank you guys so much for your words of support. Reading everything you all wrote put so much in perspective and I'm so grateful for that. And thank you for sharing your own stories of grief. It's not easy, but it helps knowing I'm not the only one.

I'm doing a little better now, but it still hurts. It's extra weird for me now too because literally 12 hours after losing Abby, I gained another family member and became an uncle a second time. I now have a second niece that I can't wait to meet! The cycle of life continues, I guess.

There will come a time when I can adopt another dog, but obviously not now. I guess its a force of habit, but I've already started looking at Petfinder. Nothing too serious, it's a weird habit I developed as a kid. I'm in no position (especially financially) to provide for another dog, but it will happen at some point.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d0krs0/i_lost_my_dog_over_the_week_and_i_feel_empty/
mightbeazombie,Breed recommendation; independent or eager,8,2024-05-25 19:42:55+00:00,"Hello Reddit! So we currently have a 6 month old puppy, but are planning on getting another pup once he's old enough (so in 2 years or so). However, since reputable breeders have wait lists that are years long, we'd like to start looking into a breeder already. Hence, we need to settle on a breed and need your help!

***\*Introduction\****

***\*1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?\****

No; my family had a Karelian Bear Dog mix (we suspect there was GSD in there, but never confirmed) growing up, and gf & I currently have a Husky/Shiba/x. mix.

***\*2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?\****

Breeder.

***\*3) Describe your ideal dog.\****

There are two kinds of dogs that I love, and funnily enough, they're almost the exact opposite.

On the one hand I love the aloof, ""knows their own worth"", cat-like, ""will chill near you but not ON you"" types that don't necessarily care to please you unless you make it worth their while. (Shiba, Akita, Shikoku).

On the other, I also love the kinds that love training sessions as much as I do, that want to do things with you and feel they have a purpose, and love having a job. The type you can do obedience, agility or other sports with, and they're THERE for it. For example German Shepherds and Border Collies.

I'm not looking for a combination of these two types (though if you have suggestions for that I'd be **very** curious how that would even work), so either works. Some traits that are universal preferences though: active, healthy, can withstand the weather even when it's very cold, eager to come with for any hikes/trips/whathaveyous, can chill at home once properly exercised, good appetite. Ideally one that I could take with me wherever.

***\*4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\****

(Japanese) Akita, Shiba, Shikoku, Basenji, German Shepard, Border Collie, Australian Shepard, Lapponian Herder, Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute. In the case of the latter two, I'd do canicross/skiing with them.

***\*5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?\****

Basic obedience is a must, but beyond that, as many kinds of things as the dog is willing and capable of learning! I enjoy the training aspect a lot.

***\*6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility,  obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting,  herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have  with this work/sport?\****

Potentially! At the moment I'm most interested in scent work since our current pup loves it so far, but obedience (rally or no), agility, canicross and skijoring are absolutely on the table if they're something our dog shows interest/affinity in.

***\*Care Commitments\****

***\*7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?\****

Difficult to pinpoint an hour amount, but a fair bit! Again, I love training, so as much as the dog can handle on that front, and I tend to do short play/interaction/training/handling sessions scattered throughout the day (since I work from home). Plus the long walks and a few dog sports throughout the week... uhh maybe like 4-6ish hours a day, added all together?

***\*8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What  sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does  that include using a dog park?\****

When the dog's an adult, three x 30min-1h walks a day, and yes, there is a dog park nearby that I've taken our current pup to a lot and would like to continue using. There's also a dog forest we plan to go to weekly (that one can be reserved so it's just us, we've gone a few times with the pup, but the way there is long and tires him out still). Also, longer walks/hikes and swimming at times! Notably, we do not have a yard (apartment).

***\*9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\****

Ideally, we wouldn't need to visit a pro groomer or dedicate hours upon hours to grooming. The amount our double coated pup requires now is about the maximum.

***\*Personal Preferences\****

***\*10) What size dog are you looking for?\****

I love big dogs, gf loves smaller dogs, a range that is ideal for both of us would be something like 15-25kg, give or take a 5kg in each direction. If we did get a big breed like a German Shepard (she has specifically okayed them as an exception to the no-big-dogs rule because she also loves them), we'd get a female to balance things out, and vice-versa if the breed was small.

***\*11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?\****

I'm fine with shedding, even if it's heavy - our current pup sheds a lot anyway! I would prefer a dog that can be taught not to bark incessantly; alarm barking once or twice here and there is fine. Ideally very minimal slobber.

***\*12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?\****

I consider it a nice bonus, but not a necessity. We live in the middle of a city, we're never going to risk the dog off leash here anyway. Free in a forest would be nice but again, fenced-off dog forests and longer leashes exist.

***\*Dog Personality and Behavior\****

***\*13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?\****

One that's in-between, but leaning more towards the personal space side of things. One that is cool just existing in the room with us most of the time, but can curl up on the couch near/next to us from time to time too. Doesn't need to enjoy petting a whole ton (but it's okay if they do!), as long as they are comfortable being handled.

***\*14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?\****

This is where the duality of my earlier answer comes up again, ha. I like both kinds for different reasons.

***\*15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?\****

We'd prefer the dog to ignore strangers for the most part. One of the best parts of walking our current pup and taking him to places is that he doesn't care about the humans we pass by. I'd love to continue that.

***\*16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?\****

If the dog can't be taught out of it, no. We have another dog at our home already, and they do need to get along. A lot of my friends also have dogs, and we pass by tons of them on every walk.

***\*17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?\****

I wouldn't like constant barking, an irredeemably aggressive dog, or a dog that gets super excited about strangers, and of course, we'd need a dog that can be taught not to chase our cat. So if their hunting instinct is so strong that the dog can never be trusted near the cat without constant supervision, that's a no-go.

***\*Lifestyle\****

***\*18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?\****

I can work from home and do most of the time, but I do want to visit the office a few times a week even when gf is at work. So though it wouldn't be every day, I'd like a dog that **can** be left alone for 8 hours when needed (once they're an adult of course), provided they get a good morning walk before and after. The dog would have another dog for company.

***\*19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the  house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?\****

I'll be the main person training and doing sports with the dog, but otherwise gf will take care of the dog as much as I do. She likes small-medium dogs with ""cute"" faces that look fluffy - I like medium-big dogs with short coats and long snouts. So... there is some conflict there, haha. She has okayed all the breeds I mentioned before, and her list would include Pomeranian, Klein/Mittel/Grossspitz and the Finnish Lapphund, all of which I'm wary of because of their coats and grooming needs.

***\*20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?\****

Husky/shiba/etc. mix, currently only 6 months old, but he'd be an adult when we get the other dog. Also a 7 year old cat. Our house will definitely always have cat(s).

***\*21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?\****

Most likely not, but it'd be nice if the dog wasn't fearful of them on the rare chances they do. The dog doesn't need to enjoy/play with/let the kids pet it or anything, though.

***\*22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?\****

We're renting, but there are no restrictions. There are huskies living in the same apartment complex, for reference. 

***\*23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?\****

Finland, no banned breeds.

***\*24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?\****

Summer 50F-77F or so, Winter: 14F to -4F, can get down to -22F at times, though it's rare this south. Winters are long, there's snow more or less for 6 months.

she learns quickly, so i think she'll understand agility pretty quick. i was thinking of teaching her to jump over things, or the trick when they move through the cones. 

is agility fulfilling for dogs? will it help tire her out? i wouldnt do anything crazy, no huge jumps, just enough to get movement and exercise, and only a few times a week ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1d0j1q8/how_to_know_if_agility_training_is_a_good_idea/

She's a very gentle dog that we thought she didn't know how play. But little by little we noticed she likes certain ""things"" to play with..an actual stick/branch or twig to play with fetch, but when we bought a toy stick to play fetch with..she was not interested. We have chew toys, IQ treat ball etc.. but she rather chew and shred GENTLY a soft piece of cardboard. we thought maybe she has teeth/gum problems that actual hard stuff she doesnt want to chew and only cardboard. We have a snuffle mat but she's smart to find the treats quick and doesnt do any ""enrichment"" to her i guess. But i gave her a piece of cardboard and she was happy shredding it gently. so I was wondering if you have any recommendations for toys similar to tearing and shredding cardboard?

However, I have yet to find a toy that squeaks that he can't de-squeak within a couple minutes. He doesn't tear things apart all that much, he just manages to disable the squeak. We've tried normal toys, which he just pierces the plastic squeaker and then they don't work. I tried a hard rubber (think classic Kong toy) one where the squeak was part of the physical design, but again -- de-squeaked within minutes.

Any ideas for more durable squeaks? I don't expect there's a squeaker in existence that he can't eventually de-squeak, but something that lasted like... a full day at least would be nice.

de1iciouslycheesy,Tips for exercising a low energy dog?,27,2024-05-25 01:42:13+00:00,"Hello, my Aani is an Aussie Terrier mix with about 14% Great Pyrenees in her (resulting in a medium sized dog). Despite her DNA being mostly high energy dog she ended up with the low energy Pyrenees' temperment. And this has made maintaining her weight a bit difficult...

I've been working on her diet but was wondering if anyone has tips for keeping low energy dogs active? I have a big yard for her to play in but even if I actively try to play fetch with her she prefers laying on the porch, gaurding the house from squirrels, occasionally doing a paremeter check. When we go on walks we barely make it half a mile before she's dragging me back to the car (she enjoys the car ride more than the walking). Even at daycare she spends most of her time demanding pets from the handlers instead of playing with the other dogs. 😅

Lady_Catsnake,Need help choosing a breed (large calm dog) ,2,2024-05-24 22:39:03+00:00,"Hello,   
I'm looking for some breed recommendations, even if I know each individual is different, I'd like some informations on often seen behavior in those breeds.   
I'm not a native english speaker, sorry for the mistakes !   
I've filed the template : 

\*\*Introduction\*\* 

1 )Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?   

\* It'll be my second dog, my first dog was a Cavalier King Charles, I've trained him when I was a teenager. 

 2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?   

\* No preference, but I'm not looking for a puppy, so, I guess more of a rescue.    

3) Describe your ideal dog.   

\* A calm one, who likes to chill and cuddle. I'd still like to have some playtime, but 30min of intense playtime is enough. I'd love to have a companion who can provide emotional support and be in phase with me. A reassuring presence. 

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?   

\* I like sighthounds because some are seen as couch potatoes with short impulse of energy, I like the size of some of them, quite tall. I also like Eurasier because of the look and the calm demeanor. I also like Bernese Mountain dogs because they are big balls of fluffy happiness, but the short lifespan is a nope for me.   

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?   

\* To be a great companion, walk on a leach, to come back, and to stay. Not that much else.   

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?   

\* No thank you. Not fond of competition   

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*     

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?   

\* I think 2-4 hours a day    

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?     

\* 1-2 hours on slow walk. I'm not healthy enough to do joggings (yet!) There is no dog parks in my town. But we have collective walks.    

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?   

\* 10 minutes a day I think? I'm ok to do the cleaning at home, but not confident in my trimming hair skills. A groomer is a good idea for that   

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*   

10) What size dog are you looking for?   

\* Large, a good size begins around 60cm and more.  

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?   

\* I'm ok with shedding. I have sensory issues with slobber and high pitched barking.   

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?   

\* Not that important.    

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*   

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?   

\* A snuggly one ! Personal space is optional.    

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?   

\* I don't understand this question very well... I'd prefer if my dog doesn't ignore me all day, but I'd prefer if they don't have a nervous breakdown if I'm doing something not related to them. More like a let's chill together kind of dog.       

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?     

\* I'd prefer to have a friendly dog with visitors, but a timid one is okay. Not aggressive.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?   

\* Not that much, a bit too anxiety inducing for me.    

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?   

\* A low-prey drive is needed because I have other pets. I can separate, but a co-existence is preferred. I'd prefer to avoid destructive behaviors, but my others pets (ferrets) are destructive too.. We just learn to have resistant furnitures..    

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*   

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?   

\* For now, I can't work due to health reasons, so I'm at home all day. I don't think I'll go back to a full time job. My companion also work at home half of the week. We sometimes have plans in the weekend (8 hours max), but it isn't mandatory.    

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?    

\* My companion love dogs. He'd prefer more of a small to medium dog, but we'd agreed that would be my dog, so I'd be responsible for it. He is on board with my project, I'm not doing the adoption without him.   

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?   

\* I have 3 ferrets, 2x5 years old, and one 3 y.o. They live in a cage with some roaming time in the living room under supervision when they ask for it. (\~2 hours a day )    

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?   

\* No   

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?   

\* I rent. We have a breed restriction against some ""att\*ck dog"" mix (purebred is ok), like all the country (Not fond of this law, I find it dumb, but I don't really have a choice here). The rest is ok   

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?   

\* I live in France. Pitbull mix, rottweiler mix, mastiff mix and others are heavily regulated. Purebred of the same breeds are still regulated, but less strictly.    

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?   

\* In summer, in a typical day, it is around 22°C. In winter, it is around 8°C.   

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*   

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.   

\* I have a very weak mental health due to depression. I hope that a dog would help me with my struggles.

Also, we live in an apparment, 70m2, with access to a big park in 2 min walk. I'd like a breed with minimal health problem. My first dog being a Cavalier King Charles, I'm done with bad selection doing its worth.

  
Thanks a lot for your help and infos ! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1czxe71/need_help_choosing_a_breed_large_calm_dog/
ShadowBomber,Looking for obstacle toy suggestions for Golden Retriever who likes to use her paws.,11,2024-05-24 18:56:52+00:00,"Hello!

My family has a golden retriever. I cant quite figure out if she's smart or lazy.. but if I had to guess she's a mix of both. 

Her favorite game to play is one she made up all on her own and I've never seen another dog intentionally do this. 

We call it ""Table ball"" or ""Lazy Ball"". She plays it by herself or with the whole family. We have a rectangular coffee table that has a 4inch~ gap at the bottom thats the perfect size for her balls to get trapped under because she can still reach them. She purposefully nudges her ball under there and then goes and tries to get it. 

If you throw the ball for her she'll fetch it but wont bring the ball to you. She'll bring it to the table and lay at one side it and wait/pout for you to sit at the other side and she'lll pass the ball to you under the table. Kiiind of like air hockey. She'll nudge it with her nose or her paws. 

I dont know I think it's very crafty when its something we as a family watched her do and learn all on her own. It took us a while to figure out she wanted us to play with her. 

Since her birthday is near I thought maybe there'd be some good games/toys that might be interesting to her but I cant seem to find anything similar so I'm here seeking help!

Negative_Ad3944,Help/advice pleaseee! ,1,2024-05-24 17:50:01+00:00,"Hey everyone, 

So I’ve bought a beautiful little puppy for my partner and son. We are all very excited to have a family dog! But I didn’t even THINK about the fact I need to pick this puppy up in the next few days…. And it’s HALF TERM!! My little boy is great with animals but he is young and will want to go out and do lots of things. I have the whole half term free, but my partner is working. So I am the only one at home! 

Should I wait until the latest date I’ve been offered to pick the puppy up (which means I have at least a few days of the half term for us to do things together) or should I pick the puppy up sooner rather than later to get him settled in?? 

I know we won’t be able to leave the house much or for long periods of time once we have the puppy. He is 8 weeks and hasn’t had his second vaccinations yet so he can’t leave the house. 

I suppose what I’m asking is. Should I pick the puppy up sooner rather than later AND how long (if at all) can I leave him alone if I take my son to the park etc? He will be in a crate to keep him safe. 

Someone please help!!

According-Dress-9529,Help with Peeing issue?,1,2024-05-24 17:02:32+00:00,"So; we have a 9 month old German Shepherd, not fixed.

The issue we're having is that he's crate trained entirely. He has cues that tell us when he needs to go, and even if he doesnt give those cues, he goes out on regular intervals. Every 4 ish hours unless he whines or paws the crate door before its time to go out.

He's REALLY good about giving those cues. Consistently he gives them, every time he needs to go. No messes, nothing. He's great about it.

Except randomly, after 3-4 weeks of no issues, he'll just...suddenly pee in the crate with 0 warning whatsoever. Nothing different happens. He goes on daily walks, has play time 2-3 times a day, food twice a day with training and enrichment toys (puzzles mostly). If he really HAS to, we know he can hold it 9+ hours EXCEPT these random moments.

Its so sudden and without warning, and he normally ALWAYS gives warning. Even if I take him out 2-3 times in an hour he will do it. We can't figure out why these random times he cant hold it, and doesnt give any warnings or cues. Even our trainer can't figure it out. Medical issues have been ruled out as well.

EDIT:   
I've tried everything the wiki suggests; 

- Ruled out any medical issues  
- started from the top and taken out hourly and slowly lengthened the interval again until another accident  
- praised + rewarded for peeing outside  
- done a set schedule  
- taken out at every sound/peep  
- taken out after eating, and the moment he wakes up from any naps + before and after play time, training, or walks  
- kept his crate completely empty until peeing issue was handled  
- has been in the same location   
- has a verbal cue (go potty)   
- crate is big enough to stand, turn around, lay down - even tried too small of a crate and no difference  
- use an enzyme cleaner after every mess  
- interrupt his peeing(he doesnt stop) and immediately take him outside   
- does not get punished for accidents, just an attempt to re-direct  
- he has a cue, and uses it consistently minus these completely random + unprompted incidents 

The only thing that seems to work is restricting water and giving a controlled amount) but I dont like doing that. If I do not do that; he'll guzzle water, but there is nothing medically that makes him do that. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1czpno6/help_with_peeing_issue/

It's not as bad at night, but he still wakes up every few hours and starts crying, only stops when I shush him to sleep.

tracysmullet,How do I begin to train my herding dog to break from her tunnel vision/leash reactivity?,1,2024-05-24 15:18:00+00:00,"Hi all,

I have an australian cattle dog mix who has some behaviors I really need to train out of her, but I’m not sure where to begin. 

Some basic info- she’s 9 years old, mostly cattle dog but she has chow, border collie, and german shepherd mixed in her. She knows basic commands; sit, lay down, shake. She did go through a puppy training years ago but she probably doesn’t have any of that memorized anymore. 

Her behavior problems I’d like to address are first and foremost her leash reactivity. She has horrible reactivity to dogs and other animals when she’s on a leash- she goes ballistic if she sees another dog or animal on walks. It’s incredibly embarrassing because it appears as if she’s gonna attack the other animal. Her bark is incredibly snarly and intimidating sounding and she lunges and tries to pull out of my hands. However, she is not aggressive and has never hurt an animal. When we go to the dog park, she plays normally with the other dogs, and if she’s allowed to go up to the dog she’s barking at, she just sniffs them, she’s not actually trying to attack. It’s only on a leash or when she’s being restrained that she freaks out like this. 

The other thing I’d like to train out of her is her weird obsession with cats. I think this one really has to do with her herding instincts, however, we used to live with cats, and she cohabited with them well enough, but whenever one of them would get up to walk somewhere, or was doing something she didn’t like, she’d immediately get up and follow them, get all up in their business, and has even gotten mouthy with them to get them to do something else. She’s chased them as well whenever they’re running and playing, and to me it’s more herding type behavior than playing behavior. She’s gotten scratched because of her being all up in their business multiple times, but she’s never hurt any of them. It’s like they just have to be doing and be in a place that she deems is okay at all times or she’ll insert herself. 

I plan on moving in with a friend who has a cat within the next year or so, and I really want to be able to train these things out of her beforehand, because I do not want the stress of her stressing out/being all up in my friend’s cat’s business. 

My only issue with her is this- People usually say to use treats to train, or toys, or something to pull their attention away from a trigger. She is not motivated at all by these things when she is focused on something. When she is in this herding mode/leash reactivity mode, nothing pulls her focus away. I’ve tried treats in the past, her favorites, and she doesn’t care. Once she’s locked in, she’s locked in. It makes training borderline impossible and idk how to go about training a dog with laser focus and not motivated by anything. This is why following youtube videos or stuff like that doesn’t work for my dog. 

Can I get some advice on how to proceed with this? Should I speak to a trainer maybe? I don’t have professional trainer money to do this, but I would just like some advice from anywhere I can pull it. Thanks in advance!

Should we re-crate him? or is there an idea of why he can be behaving this way? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1czme64/fully_trained_dog_constantly_having_accidents/

Sea-South-8636,Need advice on caring for my paralyzed pug,1,2024-05-24 13:49:14+00:00,"Hello all, 

I know that I can google this or speak with my vet, but I just wanted some advice from anyone who may have firsthand experience with taking care of a paralyzed dog.

My pug, Burke, is 14 years old and about 2 weeks ago he fell off of a platform outside of our apartment. I feel terrible that it’s happened and I can’t go back and change that part, so please refrain from shaming me for that because that’s a whole other thing I’m currently dealing with.

I took him to the emergency vet the day that it happened, and they kept him overnight and did x-rays. The x-rays were inconclusive and the vet recommended an MRI. However, agreeing to the MRI meant agreeing to immediate surgery. I did not want to put my old man through that. I decided to take him home and care for him the best that I can.

He is incontinent and my partner and I have to manually express his bladder and bowels. He is constantly leaking urine though, and I’m not sure how much control he has of his bowels. The poop still falls out of him sometimes. He is still his old self, eating and drinking okay, and seems in good spirits. 

Here are the areas where I need advice:

1. What kind of bed to use that’s easy to wash daily? I currently put down a potty pad and a towel on top of the dog bed. Even in a diaper, everything smells like pee.

2. What to wash him with and how often? I wash him and change his diaper about 3-4 times a day. I wash him with antibacterial soap and some dog shampoo with warm water and a wash rag. I’m afraid this may be irritating him. I also apply lotion before putting on the diaper.

Also, if there’s another sub I should share this in that y’all think would be helpful please let me know. Thank you!:)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1czl6m6/need_advice_on_caring_for_my_paralyzed_pug/
bookwyrm5000,Dog changing sleeping place,1,2024-05-24 13:44:42+00:00,"Hey all!  Bit of a weird situation here, not even sure it's a problem - just a new thing.

We sleep downstairs in the basement, where it's cool and quiet and dark, and my dog has a kennel with a bed and blanket in there.  Since we brought him home as a baby (he's 4 years old now) he's always slept either in his kennel (usually with the door open) or on the bed with us.  But recently, just this past week, I've woken up to find him sleeping on the main floor on the couch.  I haven't seen any evidence of garbage shenanigans, or getting into other stuff he's not supposed to.  The only thing I could think maybe is that he hears mice and wants to go investigate?

I've heard of dogs starting to sleep on colder surfaces in hot months or away from their ""pack"" as they near end of life, but didn't see other stories of leaving his bed, forgoing our bed, to go sleep on the couch by himself?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1czl33u/dog_changing_sleeping_place/
pjyelton,Why our dog snaps at air while resting?,1,2024-05-24 13:37:38+00:00,"We have a 3 year old Bernedoodle who has been doing an odd habit now for a couple months that we can't explain and are curious if anyone knows why she may be doing it.

Not sure how best to explain this but basically when she is resting but still awake she will put her head over the edge of something like a couch so her head is angled downward.  Then she will just randomly start snapping at air, like she is trying to catch something in her mouth.  It isn't constant, maybe happens once every 1 to 3 minutes or so.  Lately she has been starting to also put her head in the couch cushions so her head is covered and we can hear her make the same noises.  Last few days she has done it even when her head is sideways and napping on our laps so its starting to become a bit of a sleep habit as well.  Haven't seen it yet when she is sleeping on the ground though.

Any idea why she might be doing this?  We aren't concerned, just curious.  Our initial thought was maybe she has a stuffy nose and she thinks she is catching the mucus she can feel running down her nose when she is in that position, but its been going on for so long now.  Tried searching for it but google results keep showing air snapping in terms of dogs being playful or excited.

zidane5194,Wanting to get a new puppy question,2,2024-05-24 13:33:52+00:00,"I got a question for my fellow pet owners. I'm considering expanding my fur family by getting a puppy to go with my two cats. I'm trying to figure out what kind I want though. Admittedly, most of the dogs that my family has owned over the course of my life has mainly been mutts. There was the occasional full blood etc. But, they were also mainly ankle biter type dogs as well. So, I'm not sure what breed I'm looking for. I want a medium size dog that would be easy to train. I currently live in a duplex with a medium sized fenced in back yard. There is also 2 off leash dog parks within a 5 mile radius of me and I'm less than a block from the walking trail that runs through the middle of town. So, outdoor activity isn't an issue. Now comes the unicorn requirement. I don't want a really barky dog. One that is more or less quiet unless there is something up that I need to know about. I have looked at several sites and such. The closest I can find to what all I want is either an Australian Shepherd or a Mini Australian Shepherd. Does anyone have any experience with these breeds?

GavinB5784,Help with aggression issue... (Husky/1 yr/female),1,2024-05-24 12:40:02+00:00,"Hi, looking for some help here.

We have a one year old female husky...a rescue we've had for a couple of months now.

The other night after dinner, she attacked my mom as she was clearing the dishes off the table, specifically I believe one that had some of the food she had. My brother and I heard the barking and screaming and rushed down the stairs...as soon as my brother pulled her by the collar to get her away from my mom, she started having a go at him repeatedly trying to bite and chase him. He had to hide in the bathroom. It was only once I got the leash on her that she stopped, though she did seem like she was going to make for my brother a bit after. We had no choice but to keep her in her crate. She seems like she's come out of whatever phase she was in, but I'm at work and my mother and brother are still too wary of her to let her out of the cage until I get home. Yes, I know the crate is frowned upon but given there was an attack, didn't know what else to do.

She's generally not at all aggressive but there have been a couple of incidents in the past where she had bit my mom or at least tried and it tends to be over something being taken away from her. I take it we are looking at food aggression here and what happened last night was a more extreme version of what we had seen earlier and then attacking my brother was re-directed aggression. Maybe she's funny with my mom because of being female and this is some pack hierarchy stuff? She won't pull this sort of thing on me as she seems to think I'm the ""alpha""

Anyway, this is a big worry for obvious reasons- I worry that something more serious will happen soon enough and I really don't want to lose her. Obviously we are going to have to get her trained out of this. I am considering a professional trainer and/or behaviorist vet, but in the meantime, I was hoping I could get some insight or advice here, what sort of things can I be doing?

My dog Nico (a white German Spitz mix) is about 12 years old. I've had him since he was 6 months and love him very much as my right hand best boy.
He has picked up a new habit of growling and woofing at me randomly. I say woofing because it's not an aggressive Bark, it's more just a woof to get my attention I assume. And his growling is more of a grumbling than a warning.
Anyways, nothing about our lives or routine has changed in the last several months. We moved houses last year, my gf moved in with us, but these changes have been here for some time now.
I don't really know what he's playing at, honestly. He's eating the same, we go on our daily walks, he gets his daily treat. But still, last few weeks he's picked up this new habit.
My feeling is he's just being grumpy and cussing out the back of my head while I work. When he does this I offer to pet him and it's a 50/50 if he wants pets or not. I think he's bored and trying to get attention, but I already play with him and walk him as part of our routine and again this is new for him.

Anyone know if doggie dementia is a thing?

Dashing-or-Gorgeous,Seeking laid-back companion dog.,4,2024-05-24 03:34:07+00:00,"\*\*Introduction\*\*

4)      What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

9)      How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
  
I am willing to brush as often as needed, and take trips to the groomer.

Somewhat important, but it won’t be the end of the world if they can’t.

ShibeLock,Recommended Dog Breeds For First Time Owner,22,2024-05-24 02:50:39+00:00,"Hello, 
I am looking to get a dog finally but will be moving with my mother. I'm trying my best to find something that will be a good for us both. She would like a small, quite low maintenance dogs that do not shed. Whereas I want a medium to large dog I can cuddle and train to do tasks like help bring in groceries. 

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
This will be the first time I've owned a dog but I have babysat and cared for a few before. My mother has zero experience with dogs other than being bit by the family German Shepherd as a child. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

My mother would like to get a puppy. I have no preference. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.
Uh for me it's big enough to cuddle, can learn tricks but is fine with some alone time. It would be nice if it was big enough to have most people avoid us during walks, not aggressive persay. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
I am currently considering a Shiba inu since it's not too big, it's can be a quiet dog and very smart. Though downside they're big shedders, so mom won't be too happy. But I am a bit biased since I love shibas. Otherwise golden retriever, lab, borzoi, beagle, Shepard are on the list

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
I want to train my dog to help me bring in groceries, open and close doors or bring me objects that fall.

No not interested in that. 

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
I would love to play with the pup everyday and cuddle. I am looking for a pal to motivate me to go on adventures in our local nature trails. 

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I would like to go for 1 to 2 hour walks in the morning then a 1 hour walk at night after work. My mom and I have different schedules so they pup will have plenty of time to stretch their legs outdoors. Where we are moving to has a dog park as well and I plan to leave them at a dog daycare if we won't be home at the time. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
I already have a cat that I groom adding the pup to the plan is no deal. I'm open to all of the above. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?
Medium
11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
I do not mind as long as it's not constant barking. My mom would like no shedding, barking or slobber at all. 

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
Not important. We live in an apartment. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

No I would rather not.

Uh just not constant barking. Barking is fine just not all day every day. 

**Lifestyle**

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

spiritualRyan,Senior dog will only go for a walk - around my car,1,2024-05-24 02:28:08+00:00,"My senior dog likely has arthritis but is being given gabapentin twice a day. When I try to walk him I go very slow and let him choose the pace. But now he doesn't want to go for walks anymore outside the house. Now he just wants to go to my car lol. So I decided to just literally walk in cicrles around my car maybe 30-40 times just now and took the leash off and he followed really well and seemed to enjoy it. 

Other than the risk of having the neighborhood watch put me on a list of strange individuals to monitor closely, is doing this okay?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1czac1p/senior_dog_will_only_go_for_a_walk_around_my_car/
hornetgoon,Frustrated young aggressive dog owner,1,2024-05-24 02:26:11+00:00,"Hello my dog is a young almost two year old pound puppy mutt. I have had her for almost a year and a half. She white with a husky tail, pitty smile and the coloring of a cattle dog. 

She has become aggressive recently towards other dogs and usually just stands her ground over disputes but it’s getting worse. She’s attacking dogs that come near her now. Dog parks are out and she lunges at passing by dogs. 

She lives with a black lab and they play everyday and love each other. But she has even bitten him over food lately. 

Today I found an empty dog park and let the dogs play. When someone was entering the park I asked them to hold up as I put her muzzle on but they didn’t hear me and their dog ran playfully directly at my dog and it caused a fight. I feel awful it’s my fault. I didn’t intend to bring her to the park only to walk her around and let my other dog play at the park (under supervision). 

I’m super sad, I don’t know if this is going to get worse or what training I should get. I don’t know how to correct this behavior. When I got a dog I just didn’t want one thing an aggressive dog. And now I have one!  My other dog is a sweet kind boy I don’t know what I did to create this aggression. 

Ugh any advice on what to do next?

ihaveadogyayyy,"I feel guilty, even though I know I shouldn’t",1,2024-05-24 02:13:05+00:00,"I’ve had issues with a dog in my building who doesn’t like my dog. It translated into him not liking me as well and at one point he bit my leg. His owner is super sweet and so apologetic and I’ve actually gotten to know the dog better and he likes me now.  

However, I was taking my dog out the other day, and this dog saw him, and was able to wiggle his way out of his harness, and attacked my dog. So to be fair, I have a 50 pound husky. This dog is a 10 pound something, I don’t know what. He didn’t hurt my dog at all. And my dog is the sweetest boy ever, and he did nothing more than growl at this dog who was attacking him.

I work for the apartment community where we live at so the next day she came by my office and profusely apologized and was talking about her next steps with her dog. She’s going to be muzzling him. Right now he’s just been in doggy prison where he is not being allowed to hang out in common areas. They go on walks and to the bathroom but they’re not hanging around. She is considering possibly rehoming him. 

The woman who owns him, she’s older and she’s has terminal cancer. She is such a sweetheart. And in spite of everything, I actually really like her dog. He’s not aggressive towards any other animals or people. It’s just my dog that he has issues with. His owner says that he was attacked by a large dog a few years ago and that’s probably why he hates my dog so much.

I just feel so bad for the little dude. His owner made it very clear that I did absolutely nothing wrong and that it was on them completely. And I know I did nothing wrong. I still feel bad.   ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cza1uf/i_feel_guilty_even_though_i_know_i_shouldnt/

He also didn't respond that way when my daughter (whos seen him more than I lately) took seven of them out the next day. I've been giving him lots of treats and affection since so he knows that I care for him and that I was trying to help him, but its been three days and nothing has changed. Why would he act so badly to me doing it but not my daughter? are dogs really this sensitive? Does he not know that I'm trying to help him?

SupportWeak5203,Recommend my next heart breed,0,2024-05-24 02:10:42+00:00,"\*\*Introduction\*\*



1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?



\* No it will not be my first dog. I have had dogs my whole life. I currently own a female dalmatian and a female dachshund. In the past I have had Great Danes, English Springer Spaniels, and a German Shepherd. Training wise I had just barely dipped my foot into conformation for a year or two before a medical condition arose and I had to take a couple years away. I have done fastcat, some barn hunt, and some general obedience. 



2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?



\* I would prefer to go with a reputable breeder. 



3)	Describe your ideal dog.



\* I would like a ‘velcro’ dog breed. Something that is biddable and easy to train. I would like to be able to do conformation. I would also really like to do some dog sports of some kind. Fastcat is usually a given, barn hunt, dock diving, rally, obedience, scent work… just a few that we are interested in. They may not have to do everything listed, but it would be fun to diversify. I recently had to euthanize my german shepherd, who was 15-16 years old (She was adopted so we don’t know the exact year), and she was my shadow. She followed me everywhere and was always close at hand. I would like to find that same companionship with another dog. One that will want to be close by. I also am now in remission and recently had weight loss surgery, so I am also looking for a walking partner to go out multiple times a day. 



4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?



\* I honestly am fairly open to breed suggestions. I would not mind another German Shepherd (though the hair is a lot). I want a generally healthy breed that does not have breed specific health issues that can pop up without warning and take a dog’s life. We lost a dog due to one, only dog I have ever lost due to anything but old age, so I am far more hesitant when it comes to sudden causes of death. I had considered maybe golden retrievers or labs because of their biddability. I just really want a good versatile, biddable, trainable, velcro dog. So any breeds that fall in line with that, I am open to hearing them.



5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?



\* Ideally I would like to be able to get CGC. I want to do some kind of rally or obedience from there. My husband has always wanted to do dock diving and it seems like a lot of fun. Barn hunt was always fun when we tried it. Fastcat we absolutely love. Conformation I would like to be able to do but if I did I would be looking for a mentor to help me, because that world does still truly intimidate and confuse me.



6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?



\* I would like to be able to do dog sports, but I am not really looking to do any kind of work. 



\*\*Care Commitments\*\*



  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?



\* Well I work from home and have access to the dogs all day. I would be putting in several hours a day with them. 



8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  



\* I want to be able to do multiple walks each day. We also have a pool with a dock, if we do dock diving. We have a large backyard and plenty of toys for frisbee or ball. No dog parks, they’re a catastrophe waiting to happen. 



9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?



\* I prefer shorter haired dogs, HOWEVER, I am willing to brush regularly and invest in a really good groomer for the right breed. 



\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*



10)	What size dog are you looking for?



\* I tend to prefer medium or larger dogs. 



11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?



\* Shedding doesn’t tend to bother me. Barking I would prefer less barking or none, though I know that’s not always an option. I do not mind alert barking, I just don’t want a dog that barks incessantly. Slobber is fine. 



12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?



\* I would like to be able to work with my dog off leash.



\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*



13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?



\* Snuggly 100%



14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?



\* Eager to please. 



15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  



\* I can go either way with this. They could be aloof with strangers or be eager to greet. 



16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?



\* No. We have 2 other dogs in our home, we don’t want any dog aggression. 



17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?



\* Dog Aggression. Resource guarding. Human aggression. 



\*\*Lifestyle\*\*



18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?



\* Hardly ever. Unless we go out to dinner or shopping, there is usually always someone home. My husband and I both work from home. My mother in law lives in the home with us and is retired, so there is usually always someone around. 



19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 



\* My husband would prefer a dog that barks as little as possible. My mother in law doesn’t really have any preferences. They will provide care when necessary when I cannot, however, this dog will primarily be mine to care for and I will be doing all the training with them for whatever sports we do. It is important to me that, while a family pet, it will be my dog to bond with. 



20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?



\* We have 1 female dalmatian. 1 female dachshund. 2 cats, 1 calico adopt and 1 ragdoll. We also keep quail but they are housed in cages off the ground. 



21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?



\* Yes. I have 1 daughter, she is 15 years old.



22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?



\* No. We own our home. 



23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?



\* We live in Effingham County, GA. There are no laws that I am aware of about breeds in this county. 



24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?



\* 59-92 are the record lows and highs for our area. 



\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*



25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.



\* I am not entirely sure what else might be relevant. There was a lot of information provided above. We are not in any rush to get another dog, so I am definitely going to take my time with whatever breed we decide to go with. If that means waiting lists or waiting for the right litter or puppy, I am entirely okay with that. I would really like a male. I feel like all the dogs I have been closest to in my life have been males. “Mama’s boys” if you will. I would really like to be able to find a breeder I can click with who is happy and willing to help, someone who is honest above all else and genuinely cares for their dogs and the people who give them homes. I will also really want all proper health screenings, chic numbers, etc. 



26) Feel free to ask any questions below.



I would really prefer recommendations from people who own or have owned the breeds they are recommending. Recommendations strictly based on breed standards are just not as valuable in my mind as first hand knowledge. Thank you in advance for everyone’s help!!

So, I live with my mom right now and my dad sent his dog, Galleta, as a gift to my sister a year ago. I adopted my dog, Pepa, year ago when she was about a month old.

I have a very nervous rescue who is already on two daily prescription medications for her anxiety. Between the meds and training, we have gotten her pretty comfortable in her day to day life, but when there are storms in the area, even as far as 10-15 miles away, I cannot find a way to calm her down. I've already tried:

* White noise / loud music / tv on
* Blackout curtains to block lightning
* Creating a den / safe space 
* Heavy exercise / enrichment before bad weather
* Thundershirt
* Lick mats, food puzzles, and long-lasting treats
* Counterconditioning by giving her a treat when there is thunder
* Happy Hoodie
* CBD Oil / Treats
* Engaging in play or snuggling / petting / talking calmly to her
* Ignoring her and acting normally
* Running the dryer / washer / loud appliances
* Adaptil Diffuser
* Desensitizing through recorded storms sounds (She seems to know the difference and shows no reaction to ""fake"" storms) 

The only thing that seemed to make a difference for her was Sileo from the vet, but it cannot be used with one of her current daily meds, so I am back to looking for other non-medication fixes.

About a month ago, my dog’s anxiety got significantly worse. She paces, drools, and hides under furniture. I took her to the vet and she is healthy, aside  from some minor arthritis that she’s now taking medicine for. I haven’t changed anything about the house, there’s no construction on our street, etc. She -did- start trying to bite the wi fi router, which makes me wonder if the router or something else is making a noise that bothers her. Has anyone else dealt with this and, if so, how did you find the source of the sound? The sound may not be what is bothering her, but if there’s a simple way to rule it out, I’d like to try.

Edit: I -did- shut off the router and it didn't make any difference, I hadn't been able to do that earlier owing to work demands. Aaaaand not the router. 

Also -- good point about a neighbor's ultrasonic anti-bark device. My dog isn't alone in the house, ever, and she doesn't bark more than once a week or so. When she does bark, it's a few woofs and done. 

We -do- have an across-the-street neighbor with a very barky labradoodle. They are moving and I hadn't heard the dog lately. I just figured he'd been relocated but i wonder if they're using one of these devices. I'll ask! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cz2wut/help_to_identify_the_ultrasonic_noise_scaring_the/

0mni0wl,I'm at the end of my leash dealing with my dog's obsessive behavior!,1,2024-05-23 20:17:08+00:00,"My dog is a 10 year old Border Terrier named Wylie, an intact male who was never neutered because he has a mild liver shunt that causes him to react negatively to medication and puts him at risk of not surviving surgery. He's pretty high energy and absolutely untrainable - we've never been able to get him to do the basics such as sit and stay, much less walk on a leash without pulling. But he's mellowed out a great deal as he's gotten older, behaving better than ever in his old age.

Recently a little girl with a small, young female dog moved into my neighborhood and our dogs hit it off immediately. They had several playdates, became fast friends and this kid became quite enamoured with my dog and I. Then it started getting out of hand with her showing up multiple times a day, trying hard to extend our time together, waking me up to ask if we could come out to play or finding her in my yard after I had already said that we were busy. 

She's 8 years old, hyperactive, and honestly not very bright. Nice kid, but overly friendly and incapable of understanding boundaries. I'm honestly worried for her - she could easily become victimized because she's too trusting and going from door to door alone trying to interact with everybody. Her Mom seems oblivious, distracted by work and her own social life, as well as incapable of keeping her overactive child close to home. The dog though... as sweet and well behaved as pets come.

Every time that she knocked on the door my dog Wylie would go absolutely berserk, but generally he was capable of calming down after a bit and was able to accept when they weren't able to play. It would be a few frantic minutes then he'd get back to normal pretty quickly. But for the most part I was just giving in and letting them interact at least once a day to keep everybody (but me) happy. It was cute to see our dogs so in love but I was honestly getting pretty annoyed with this little girl because she just cannot take a hint and has become a nuisance to the whole neighborhood.

However, about a week ago Wylie started acting like he was in a great deal of pain, having difficulty getting into certain positions and whelping when touched. I'm not sure how he injured himself but it seems like he might have pulled a muscle in his neck. We took him to the vet and had him checked out and they agreed with our assessment. The doc prescribed him Tramadol for pain, an NSAID and muscle relaxer after doing some bloodwork to check his liver levels, but she cautioned us to use it sparingly and keep a close eye out for side effects. And of course the vet recommended that we limit his activity as much as possible to give him time to heal. No playing, jumping, long walks, etc. for a week to ten days minimum.

He got a couple shots of the same meds in office and that's when the trouble started. Instead of relaxing and getting drowsy like you would expect, my dog became agitated and started panting rapidly. My husband and I thought that he was just worked up because of the vet visit, but after we gave him the first dose of oral meds later that day it became obvious that there was something else wrong. He was absurdly anxious and incapable of sitting still, even with having so much pain that he could hardly move before.

After the little girl came around with her dog and we told her that Wylie was hurt and couldn't play for at least a week he got all excited and could NOT calm down. It just got worse as time went on until he was having a full blown panic attack! He was breathing as fast as possible and whining with every breath, running from window to window while howling for many hours. Nothing we did could mellow him out or distract him for the rest of the night. It was exhausting for him and us!

After doing a little research I discovered that Tramadol can cause anxiety in dogs, so we decided to discontinue it because we had never seen our dog act so over the top in his entire life and felt like it had to be related. The next day he seemed better and finally slept after getting the muscle relaxer... until he saw the little girl and her dog again. Even though she has stopped knocking on the door she's still wandering around in front of my house, and I can't get her to stay away. It's a public street and she goes to the neighbors, so I really don't have any authority to ban her from being within view or earshot of my dog. 

Anyway, even though my dog is no longer taking the Tramadol the psycho obsessive behavior has not stopped since. He cannot relax at all, cries constantly and acts like he'd do anything to see this freaking dog again. Every time he spots them out the window or hears her voice he goes completely nuts. He's flying around the house peeking out all the windows, waking me up every couple of hours to go out just so he can try to track this dog. I'm worried that he's hurting himself because he's so frantic, can't chill and heal at all. Plus he's driving me crazy! 

I tried covering up the windows so he'd be less likely to see them, but now he's just more distraught that he can't look outside. I've given him Benadryl and CBD oil, bribed with treats, cuddled him, sprayed him with a water bottle... I've comforted him, screamed at him, ignored him, tried to distract him; I've done everything that I can possibly think of. I'm considering calling the vet about getting some anti-anxiety medicine, but with his history of not being able to metabolize things properly and having weird reactions it would be an extremely short term solution at best. (Maybe I should call MY doctor and get myself some anxiety pills instead?!?) 

At this point I don't think that I want to let him have anything to do with this girl and her dog again, even once we get through this healing period. It obviously gives my dog a great deal of joy to play with them, but he's taking things way too far and I'm afraid that rewarding him for his bad behavior by letting them be together might just reinforce this obsession. I was giving him the benefit of the doubt and blaming the Tramadol for his actions, but now it's got to be out of his system because it's been days since he had it. Maybe the other meds are causing problems too?

I've also considered that his pain may be causing him to act out and be overly emotional, but the crazy thing is that as soon as this anxiety/obsessing started he completely stopped acting like he has any pain or trouble moving around. He immediately switched to pretending like he's good to go... Perhaps the meds are working so well that he isn't actually hurting anymore, but I've still got to let the injury heal so he doesn't aggravate it again.

Under normal circumstances I would take him on a long walk to let him burn off some excess energy, but I'm trying to keep him on bedrest as ordered by the vet. He's never been crated (plus we live in an RV with no room for a cage), so I don't think that would go over very well. I know it would restrict his movement but honestly think that he'd be even more distraught and frantic if locked up. This whole ordeal must feel like a punishment to him - the pain, isolation, frustration - I'm sure he's confused about why he hurts and can't do what he normally does.

I have no idea what to do now... I am at my wits end! Does anybody have any suggestions? Has anyone ever dealt with something like this? Do y'all think that I should keep the windows covered even though he's equally upset because he can't look out and still going crazy when he hears her outside? Stop ALL the medication (NSAid & muscle relaxer) in case they are causing a reaction? Call the vet about anti-anxiety medication? Should I just let him do whatever he wants again even though there is a risk that he might reinjure himself?

How should I handle the situation with the little girl and her dog after he finally heals up? Should I continue keeping them separate forever or let him start having playdates again? On one hand it seems like he'd be a lot happier if they get to interact once a day, but on the other I'm concerned that both my dog and the kid are taking things too far, especially by misbehaving when not getting what they want and not being willing to take no for an answer. I don't want him to be miserable forever, but I also cannot deal with him acting like he's going to die if he can't spend every second of the day with this other dog. 

Thank you all for taking the time to read all of this and for providing me with your input! I'm really hoping that this is just a temporary phase due to being in pain and under the influence, but I'm also worried that this behavior might continue after he heals up as long as I keep giving in to his impulses and pressure from this child to be available on demand.

Omeads,Interesting behavior during daycare drop off and pickup,1,2024-05-23 20:00:26+00:00,"My boy: Corgi Male, 1.5 yo, has an interesting behavior during daycare drop off and pickup we can’t seem to figure out.

A local couple watches our pup a couple times a week. He absolutely adores them and vice versa. The minute he sees them he can’t help but tug. They regularly have a pack of dogs they watch that all get along.

Every drop off, without fail. My corgi will start barking at me as soon as I pass his leash off to the couple and jump at my legs. It’s not angry or scared. No bared teeth, sometimes a playful growl. But the minute I turn around and walk the other way he stops and walks happily off with the pack. 

At first we thought this was maybe a sign of separation anxiety. But he’s started doing the same behavior during pickup but in the opposite direction! When the couple gives his leash to me he barks and jumps at them! Again, no aggression and once we part ways he happily walks home.

Any idea what this could be? It’s not exactly BAD behavior but it can be a little embarrassing at times, and hopefully doesn’t become something worse. Seems like it’s his way of saying goodbye or maybe come with.

Oldest is a long haired chihuahua Lucy, 14 years old , she’s in charge. Bought her. 

Middle is Zenja -basset and pit, 12 yrs old , a love bug. Fostered fail with her. 

Axel is my youngest at 11 years old, pit. My second foster fail.hes my best buddy. From the day he walked in door. 

All are vetted twice a year. This isn’t my first animal house. lol. Have had pets most of childhood and all of adulthood. All left here from death or being euthanized, when you enter this door as a pet, you are forever here. (Hence the foster failures) 

But everything keeps holing in price! Can’t rush to vet over every issue but I will if it’s necessary.  Hoping to just get opinions. 

My youngest, Axel. I left for 4 hours exactly, usually they can go up to 5 hours. I’ve always WFH or only part time outside of home, since I’ve had these 3. 

Axel has always peed more than the average dog imo. But today he went in his kennel. I was gone 4 hours.   Last time he did this was when we first got him. 

He was trying not to lay in it, it was a pool. I cleaned  kennel and bathed him. He’s not in trouble, it’s an accident. 

Is it age? Never had dogs live past 13, these years are new to me  
Just me and my husband, no kids, ever. I walk them 4-6 nights a week. 
Plenty of love, food, water, attention. 

Does he need a vet visit? Should I limit time gone to shorter time frame? 
Should I wait and see if it happens again? 

I don’t want him stressed, he gets stressed easily, always has. He’s more nervous than the chihuahua! 

We have a doggy door and fenced in back yard but I’ve never let them have access while we are gone. Too scared a fence panel could be loose to do this. He was attacked years ago, white on a leash, by another dog not on a leash. Neighbors dog. Was horrendous, he was NOT the aggressor  but he fought back.  But I still can’t. I don’t think he would hurt anyone but many have the pit mentality, so no doggie door access without someone home. 
Responsible owners imo. 

Should we faithfully check fence panels and allow them access? I can’t hold it as long at age 50, figuring some dogs are kind of like that too????? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cyy2bk/dog_is_peeing_in_kennel/

   * We prefer to find a reputable breeder but are not opposed to adopting from a shelter, so long as it's a good match. We will check the shelter before contacting any breeders.
3. **Describe your ideal dog.**
   * Protective, loyal, relatively eager to please, & goofy
4. **What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**
   * We are thinking of the Rhodesian Ridgeback & Beauceron. We love their guarding abilities & intelligence, as well as athleticism when we go hiking or running/cycling along the beach. They are both beautiful breeds!
5. **What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**
   * The basic commands of potty training, sit, down, stay, come, & leave it. I would like the guarding instincts to kick in naturally if there is an intruder or somebody suspicious walking near me.
6. **Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**
   * Not really. think just obedience classes to get the basics down

**Care Commitments**

7) **How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

   * As much time as it takes, especially if it is a puppy! Once the dog is a bit older, I may leave him/her alone for 3-4 hours (on weekdays) but come home to go potty & play. On weekends, I plan on being with my dog all day.

8) **How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

   * On weekdays, I plan on exercising my dog about 2 hours cumulative (walking around the block). On weekends, I can go on longer hikes in the woods or runs by the beach. I plan on using a dog park sparingly, as I've heard many downsides to those.

9) **How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

   * I'm willing to do all grooming at home (hair brushing, nail clippings, etc). I am also willing to pay a professional if I'm not great at the ear-cleaning or nail-trimming stuff.

**Personal Preferences**

10) **What size dog are you looking for?**

   * Large (like 50+ pounds)

11) **How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

   * We'd like short fur, barking when alert & necessary, & a tiny bit of slobber is fine but not drool-y.

12) **How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

   * I would love my dog to be well-trained with recall & be able to run along the beach freely & play in the water if desired. It's not terribly important to me but would be a plus!

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) **Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

   * A dog that is in-between snuggly & independent would be best. I love snuggling on the couch but also want to be able to leave the dog alone at home without much separation anxiety. I don't mind getting followed to the bathroom LOL.

14) **Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

   * I'd prefer eager-to-please but also think for itself for important decisions. For instance, if I'm telling it to quit barking but it hears/sees something I don't, I want my dog to ignore me & continue barking.

15) **How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

   * This might be an unpopular opinion, but I appreciate dogs barking when someone knocks the door or enters our property. I like the heads-up! I don't want my dog to bark its head off &/or be aggressive towards any stranger, but I do appreciate a watchful, protective dog. If the dog realizes that the visitor is a welcomed friend of mine, then he/she should settle down & be accommodating.

16) **Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

   * Yes, I am willing to manage that but it's something that I need to work with a professional trainer on. I don't want an aggressive dog -- just a watchful one.

17) **Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

   * I think the only behavior I will not tolerate is aggression towards me, my partner, or our friends. While I would like a watchful dog, I do not tolerate aggression that is unwarranted or towards someone we love. The dog needs to be able to make that distinction.

**Lifestyle**

18) **How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

   * I think I mentioned this above, but only around 4 hours at a time on weekdays & very seldomly/sparingly alone on weekends. I'd want to spend as much quality time with my dog as possible :)

19) **What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

   * None really. My mother isn't a fan of large dogs but she will not be caring for my dog.

20) **Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**

   * No other pets & not planning on having other pets. We will only have 1 dog at a time UNTIL we own a house & have plenty of room for 2-3 dogs.

21) **Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

   * No children for the foreseeable future

22) **Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

   * We rent right now, no restrictions. In about 3 years, we might move into a house (that my parents own).

23) **What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

   * California (state) in the United States (country)

24) **What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

   * Summers are around 70-80 degrees F & winters can dip to maybe 40 degrees F. I'm just estimating, to be honest, but my dog will live indoors & hike outdoors only when the weather permits. I'd never put my dog in any danger if I can prevent it.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) **Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

   * Overall, my partner & I are looking for a large, guard breed that is watchful & intelligent but also goofy & sweet. We are fairly experienced & are willing to put in the time/money/energy into training a dog properly utilizing only positive reinforcement methods. We're really excited to see your breed recommendations!

26) **Feel free to ask any questions below.**

   * We greatly appreciate any suggestions you have! All in all, do you believe a Rhodesian Ridgeback or Beauceron are good fits for us? Many thanks :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cyxu7s/breed_recommendations_much_appreciated/

bella_68,One dog in the bounded pair breaks all the toys,0,2024-05-23 16:45:22+00:00,"I live with 2 large but young dogs. One is a male GSP who is honestly a little on the stupid side but really loving. The other is a spayed female Newfoundland mix who is surprisingly intelligent and in need of enrichment or she will act out. 

I got the Newfoundland first and she did very well when I had her distracted with puzzle toys. It’s kind of wild seeing her figure out a slide puzzle to get a treat. 

The GSP is a little newer but close to the same age and they get along very well. Unfortunately, the GSP is a very tough chewer. My Newfie could break toys fairly quickly but not the way the GSP does. He can’t solve puzzles the way my Newfie does so he just breaks it to get the treats instead. Any toy I give him is destroyed to the point of unsafe with in 2 days max (usually less than an hour unless it was a very good brand of tough chewer toy). 

I want to enrich my Newfoundland with toys that challenge her brain but my GSP just shoves his way in and breaks anything I give her. 

I could separate them when I’m not able to supervise, but they are closely bonded enough that they get anxiety when separated. 

Is there such a thing as a GSP proof puzzle toy? He’s a 90lb, 1 yr old GSP with a massive jaw and a need to chew. My thoughts are he is unstoppable but I thought I’d ask just in case someone had any good ideas. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cyxf6m/one_dog_in_the_bounded_pair_breaks_all_the_toys/

She’s cute, and somewhat well mannered but I don’t love her, and I can’t tell her I love her because I wouldn’t mean it. Does that sound silly?

She is our fourth dog in our household, and she is a 13 wk chocolate lab. We both had labs growing up and loved them, and finally have the time/money/energy to get one. We also have three miniature dachshunds. My oldest is 8, and I got her when I was in high school. Obviously, I love her because she was a cute little puppy that I got as a teenager and grew up with me as an adult. She’s my girl and I adore her. Our second oldest is 3 1/2 years old and from the moment I brought him home, I have loved that dog with every fiber of my being and I would truly do anything for him. That’s my child. Our youngest (besides puppy), is 2 1/2 years old and I will be honest, I finally started loving him the same way that I do for the older two just recently. He was a menace, constantly got into this, had horrible anxiety. He has been medicated for 6 months now and has finally chilled out, and I think that’s why I feel I can open my heart up to him. 

I feel sad thinking it could take as long for me to love our newest puppy. Did anyone else feel this same way or am I an odd man out?

I don't think she even noticed the pill. And I laughed and thought ""What would I do without peanut butter? 😁""

But of course, peanut butter is mostly a USA thing! Which made me realize that other countries don't have PB for their dogs. So what do you use instead?? Here, PB is like *the* spread to use with dogs... we put it on lick mats, we use it for pills, for training, for treats, for protein. I've even seen videos of people wrapping their head in plastic wrap and slathering peanut butter on their forehead so that they can clip their dogs' nails while it's licking up the PB.

So if your country doesn't have peanut butter, what type of spreadable treat do you use for all those types of uses?

Thank god I got outside in time because my precious love was wagging her tail, chillin with this coyote that was screaming his lungs off. And then today when I let my dog outside he came from around the woods behind my house. Does anyone know if he was screaming to lure my dog close or was he screaming to let his pack know what’s up.

Which dog breeds have the same or similar temperament like beagle - regarding their cheerful disposition and friendly (to everyone - especially cats they grew up with)
affectionate, playful and always optimistic nature?
Are Welsh springer spaniels/brittanys/vizslas/irish setters/any other breed (less known) not listed.

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
No, I’ve had dogajanje of different breeds before (in childhood and adulthood) and different training difficulty so you could say I have some experience dealing with obedient and stubborn breeds alike.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
I would prefer a reputable breeder, although not opposed to owning a rescue.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.
My Ideal dog is happy go lucky, optimistic, super affectionate, gets along with animals he/she grew up with e. g. cats is either friendly or aloof with other dogs, but never agressive, can be friendly or aloof but MUST be non agressive to people and is very unlikely to bite or nip, is not neurotic or easily spooked, does not drool, is not a barker unless greeting happily - that does not mean that the dog must be quiet on the contrary it does not bother me at all that the dog would be very volcal (I’m used to beagle’s vocalisations, but he is not a barker at all, only vocalises when happy on the hunt or someone rings the doorbell), a relatively healthy breed that is known to live quite long when cared for corectly, is not destructive when left alone, is energetic and playful, but has an off switch, can be eager to please and not stubborn (too much), etc.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? Considering Beagles, vizslas, basset hounds, welsh springer spaniels, brittanys, poodles, shetland sheepdogs, Irish setters, shipperkes, clumber spaniels, golden retrievers, portuguese water dogs, golden retrievers, labrador retrievers, pappillons, malteses, shi tzus, cardigan welsh corgis, barbets, lagotto romagnolos, bergamascos, norvegian lundehunds,…

All of my free time for a well rounded and happy and healthy dog when grown up.

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? Depends on the breeds exercise requirements - If low an medium energy about an hour and If high energy between an hour and a half and two hours/three hours tops. Long walks or running beside me while I’m cycling, would also prefer a breed that can go on a hike or a swim with me now and then.

If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? Once a week or less is enough, yes I would do all that home, If not possible I would pay a professional

**Personal Preferences**

No preference, but would be preferred that the breed does not get injured easily regarding size

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
I would prefer short haired breeds that do not shed much otherwise no preference so I wouldn’t exclude non shedders or moderate shedders as long as there is not fur everywhere I would look and it would not take me an excessive amount of time to clean it every day, not a barker although other vocalizations don’t bother me, and breeds that do not slobber.

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? 
Don’t mind If dog has to be on a leash in an unfenced area almost always but If I do have the dog off leash he/she must be close by, does not wander far and is obedient when I use the command of recall.

I adopted her at a year old.   She was afraid of the dark, other dogs, only used the cement to do her business, used to drink water like she would never see it again. 

In the year I have had her, she has come a long way.  She's resolved all of those behaviors and loves to have play dates with her Bernese Mountain dog best friend. 

My question is around walks.  I think she was a bloodhound in another life.  She is the ""sniffiest"" dog I've ever had.  I don't mind, we take slower walks and  I let her sniff to her hearts content.  

I always think that she would love areas that have lots of wildlife due to the smell.  Areas that may have a creek, or are slightly more wooded.  My area has lots of wildlife from deer, to foxes, geese, ducks,a few bald eagles, coyotes.  Even just in the neighborhood.

Anytime we try to explore those areas she gets extremely nervous, and as she has always been a perfect walker, in those cases, she practically pulls me home.  

She did come from a major city shelter.  It's not a huge deal to only walk her on the streets, I just thought the different  scents would be interesting to her.  

Is there a way to get her acclimated do you think, or just stick with to me boring walks that she enjoys?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cyr312/i_have_no_idea_what_she_is_afraid_of/

GroovyHummingbird,Active WFH Couple w/ Cats,0,2024-05-23 05:06:00+00:00,"
**Introduction**

Hello!

My husband and I are looking for a dog breed that will fit with our WFH, somewhat active lifestyle. We have 2 cats and plan to have kids in the next year or two. Thank you! 

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

We both had dogs as kids but were young and not very involved in their training. So this will essentially be the first time for both of us. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

We’d prefer going through a breeder. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

We’d like a dog that we can take hiking and camping but also isn’t super high energy as we do not have 2 hours daily for walking. Also a dog that will get along with cats and children. A cuddler who is also a protector. Does this type of dog breed exist? 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I’ve always really liked the spunky attitude of Australian Shepherds but also know they are super high energy. And have read they aren’t great with cats. 

Lately I’ve been gravitating towards doodles for their goofiness and cuddliness. 


5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

To be calm while we work from home. This is a major concern for us as we can’t have a dog that needs constant attention while we work from our house. 

To go hiking & camping. We live in a mountainous area and would like a dog that can accompany us on trail.

I’d like a dog to go walking and running with.

Socializing, our cats were fostered with dogs and it made such a difference in how they handle being around other animals. 


6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I think my husband and I could commit to an hour a day or active play, exercise or training. And then some attention throughout the day as we are home. But again, not sure how to handle training a dog while we wfh. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

Probably an hour, maybe longer some days. We have yard space and a nearby park. We both walk daily. I would go running with a dog.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I think we could manage weekly brushing and grooming at home. We do this already with the cats. Also wiling to pay a professional as needed.


**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Ideally medium, possibly open to smaller. I think large just doesn’t work with our lifestyle. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Minimal to all but more so with  the slobber and barking. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Very

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

More of a snuggler 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

More of a do their own thing. I think a more attentive dog may not work with WFH.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  


More on the friendly side than hostile. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No, I’d rather not 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Has to be cat friendly. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Not often. WFH and if we travel then we’d have a sitter come over. Would actually like a dog we could travel with. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

I’m responding with both our preferences 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

2 tabby cats that we fostered with medium and small dogs. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

In the future, yes. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No, we own. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Reno, NV USA. I’m not aware of any laws banning breeds. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer: 85-90, Winter: 45-50

PoisonIvy5ever,Help my dog and cat become better roommate’s ,1,2024-05-23 02:52:18+00:00,"My partner and I have an adorable 1.5 year old cattle dog/pitbull mix named Betty White that we adopted about a year ago. We also have an 8 year old cat, Taj, who’s pretty reclusive, esp since we adopted Betty. Both animals are pretty non aggressive, Taj has never even scratched me.

We were very intentional about introducing them, following all the advice about separating them and slowly breaking down the barrier over time with the use of a baby gate, and swapping their blankets. That seemed to be okay, even if Taj hasn’t really been himself since we got her. We know this adjustment can take time. 

Since then it’s seemingly gotten worse over time. Taj has swiped at Betty a couple times and it’s almost like she took it really personally (lol a sensitive diva) and is like holding a grudge, she can’t feel comfortable around him. It’s like he’s too unpredictable and just appears when she doesn’t know he’s coming. 

We have a very open apartment and Betty has her crate in the living room area and hangs out with us while we watch tv, but she thinks is HER living room. Whenever Taj tries to insert himself (which he’s doing more lately), she charges after him and kind of chases him off. She also has some sleep aggression so she freaks if she wakes up to up to him 😓. Reactions have gotten milder and they seem more comfortable fighting with each other - idk if that’s a good thing, sometimes I’m like do they just need to duke it out? But it seems Taj is the one losing out. 

We try to give them treats at the same time, encouraging positive interaction but that doesn’t seem to be enough. What do we do? We thought maybe a spray bottle but a simple google search is saying that’s not right and we really want to be intentional and thoughtful. They’re both amazing animals and I know it’s on us to figure it out! Any advice on training and behavior correction?

Now we have two 15.5lbs Science Diet Lamb and Brown Rice bags that have just sat there.

Our local shelters won’t taken open bags and I havnt found luck trying to sell or even give it away at this point.  

I was wondering if anyone has tried mixing two same brand foods together, or if anyone thinks this could cause too much of an upset stomach. I’ve seen some tips on weening from one brand to another, but worried my already sensitive stomach dogs will get upset stomach with the new ingredients. Not sure how different of protein lamb is vs chicken. 

I’m hesitant to try as we only noticed the first time when one of our dogs started having loose bloody stool and throwing up, that we bought the wrong food.

Critical-Support-394,"[Breed] Flexible, friendly farm dog",4,2024-05-22 21:39:31+00:00,"Hello, my boyfriend and I recently moved together and he desperately misses his dog, which had to stay with his mother. Chances are we will be getting a puppy down the line, so I'm thinking ahead.



1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

I've had 3 tervuerens with my family, my mom did most of the walking but I did most of the obedience training. He's had a Labrador retriever but the dog is pretty much untrained. He has had another dog too but I don't know much about it.


2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

Rescuing isn't really a big thing in Norway, so breeder, alternatively adopting an adult dog privately (but prefer a puppy).


3) Describe your ideal dog.

My second dog was an incredibly intelligent female tervueren who was up for absolutely anything (skijoring, agility, hikes with the horses, boat trips, biking, rally obedience, party tricks, service tricks, she was even my emotional support dog in middle school), was incredibly friendly, didn't bark too-too much and had a very manageable coat for the breed. She was perfect other than the fact that she went neurotic and ate her own tail and the wallpaper off the wall if she went one day without proper mental and physical stimulation.

For our future dog, most importantly it needs to be friendly with people and animals (horses, dogs, cats, chickens), and trainable (namely recall being very important). Needs to be able to come on hacks with horses, so athletic and large enough to keep up, but bonus points for one that is also okay with chilling for a few days without losing its mind. Doesn't need to be the most intelligent dog on the planet but being able to teach some fun tricks would be nice. Extremely unlikely to do anything competitively. Huge bonus if it's not a particularly loud or guarding dog. Coat length isn't a huge deal but needs to be able to cope with cold down to -15°C and snow.



4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I've been mostly thinking of labs and tervuerens as that is what we are experienced with, but am open to suggestions.


5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Learning to go around off leash on the farm around horses, chickens, possibly cats and other dogs is very important. I want to be able to bring it on hikes with and without horses. No competitions but party tricks are fun. As well as useful things like closing doors and turning lights on and off, picking stuff up off the ground to hand it off etc.



6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No


Care Commitments

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I have a chronic illness and can't reliably say. Some weeks can be a 2 hr hike in the mountains every day, some can be lying in bed feeling half dead and only being able to let the dog out on its own. 

My boyfriend can pick up the slack with physical exercise on those weeks and will happily go for a decent length walk but is not particularly experienced with mental stimulation or obedience training (at least not yet).

I am home all day and can basically hang around with the dog from I wake up until I go to bed, but not always actively.


8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? 

See above. When I'm able to ride, frequent 1+ hr hikes in rough terrain, often with long stretches of running. When I'm not, dog can run free around the farm, go on walks with my boyfriend and play with the other dogs here.

No dog park but will be meeting dogs out hiking and will live on a property with other dogs.


9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Ideally little coat and skin care but this is extremely low priority. I can learn whatever is required to do at home. 



Personal Preferences

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Medium-large

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding no issue, barking ideally as little as possible, but if dog has a deeper/not super sharp and painful voice, some is ok. Some slobber ok, not huge amounts though.


12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Basically the top priority I have is being able to go off leash


Dog Personality and Behavior

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Ideally one that is fine with either. Doesn't need to be a lapdog but absolutely needs to be okay with being up close and personal without getting anxious.




14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

One that is eager to please but ideally without being hyper-dependent on people

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? 

With friendly excitement or not caring much, but barking at visitors at first is okay as long as it's not endless. No barking at every little twig breaking.


16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No



17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

None I can think of that are not already mentioned


Lifestyle

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

A few times a week for a few hours (groceries etc)


19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Boyfriend prefers a big friendly dog and is happy to do daily care for an hour or two a day, but not experienced with any real training, his dog mostly just runs freely around inside their fenced property.



20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

There are horses, chickens and two small/medium dogs on the property. We might be getting a cat or two in the future.


21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Highly unlikely



22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We rent, but no restrictions.



23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Norway, pitbulls and some other fight bred dogs are banned as well as wolf crosses.



24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

20C in summer, -10C in winter


Additional Information and Questions

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

Health is very important, we don't need a dog with a 15 year lifespan but we need one that is as likely to be pain free, allergy cancer free etc as possible. Of course none of these are guarantees but some breeds are riskier than others.

I understand I am asking for a unicorn here and no dog breed is likely to fit all these criteria 100%. But I might as well give it a try and see what people think.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cyc4fd/breed_flexible_friendly_farm_dog/

Own-Butterscotch7346,Honestly Need Advice ,8,2024-05-22 23:49:09+00:00,"I rescued a mixed breed almost 2 months ago and he really is a great boy. He was born in the shelter and I adopted him when he was 6 months old so I was prepared for some of the behaviors I would have to correct. He is crate trained and knows several commons so far! 

The one thing I wasn’t prepared for was that about 2 weeks into having him he started fixating on shadows, he would literally go into a trance and it was terrifying. There was a time where it was hard to even take him for a walk which led to me to look it up online… and sent me down a rabbit hole of Laser Pointer Syndrome and doggy OCD. I know that we have never used a Laser pointer on him and I can’t imagine the shelter did either but I immediately scheduled sessions with a dog trainer and brought it up to our vet. 

The vet was not concerned about it and when we met with the trainer, he was already slowing the behavior.  I can happily say that he has stopped fixating on the shadows on walks, outside and in our home but he still pays somewhat attention to them at night when our spotlight is on. 

Not sure if the initial interest was because of a completely new environment and he was full of anxiety or out of boredom. We upped his exercise, started taking him to dog daycare and do tons of mental exercise with him which I feel helped rid the behavior. 

My question is… Can this be something that he can grow out of completely? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cyf0az/honestly_need_advice/

JokerBizarre,Rescue dog still uncomfortable a year later,1,2024-05-22 23:07:03+00:00,"Hello! Almost a year ago my family adopted a dog from the shelter. He’s currently 8 years old and his gotcha day is in June. He’s a pug that was rescued after being used for breeding for 7 years. My boy is a very handsome man and he’s incredibly independent. From day one he was like this and I could tell. I thought he would be too much for us and didn’t think he’d be the right fit. But my parents went through with the adoption and a year later I very much love this dog. He’s so goofy and adorable and makes my days brighter.

The issue is, that even a year later I feel like he doesn’t see us as his family. He’s come around to being pet, but even then as soon as you stop he just kind of walks away. He’s not affectionate at all, and just kinda shows the same level of enthusiasm seeing us as seeing strangers. I feel like I’ve failed him in a way. A year later and it’s like we just got him yesterday in a way. If he were to ever get lost I don’t think anyone would even believe he’s ours cause he wouldnt show much enthusiasm lol. No matter what he’ll always be our dog and we would never give him up. But I guess is there anything I can do to make my dog more trusting? I try treat training but he’s not super food or toy motivated. He’s just kinda indifferent to everyone and everything. I thought maybe getting another dog for him would help; but even  with other dogs, when he sees them he gets excited at first, but within a few minutes he’s over it. I’m a pretty calm person and we never yell at him or anything. My greatest accomplishment in life would be to get him to actively cuddle, but he doesn’t even want to be on the couch with us, he just uses his pet beds. My previous dogs were all pretty attached to us, so we thought he’d come around eventually.

Dear-Forever1143,Humping In The Dog Park,1,2024-05-22 22:07:53+00:00,"Ok, so I have a 3-year-old mutt. He's a mix between Pit Bull, American Bully, and Boxer mainly. He loves everyone, and his favorite thing to do is go to the dog park after dinner time. I live right next to a park so we just stroll on over every day for about an hour and a half, and he loves it. There are two other dogs that he specifically loves to play with. My dog is not a very dominant dog, he tends to rarely hump other dogs, and when he does, it's the two dogs he loves to play with. I keep an eye on him when he's running around, and try and intervene as soon as I see him start(which is infrequently). The reason I'm posting about this is he is usually the dog that gets humped. He will usually just stand there if another dog is humping him until either I or another owner does something about it. But there are certain people and dogs I know in that park whose dogs just relentlessly hump my dog every chance they get. My dog and another will be playing and this person's dog will interrupt the two playing and start humping my dog. I shit you not its like every minute or two the dog is back humping my dog. The owner never really does anything about it, besides just telling the dog no, which rarely works, the dog doesn't stop unless his owner starts walking over to it. I'm a pretty patient person, If I see another dog humping my dog I don't instantly think it's a bad thing, it's only natural, but when it's happening every minute, I will intervene. This started maybe  6 months ago, and since then, we started to try and avoid this couple who owns this dog, by going a little earlier in the day. I try and be courteous to other people since at first I didn't think it was that big of a deal. Then, about two weeks ago, they came to the dog park while my dog and I were still in there and he was playing around with his dog buddies. The humping start immediately. I'm pretty pissed off at this point. So his dog starts humping mine right in front of where I'm sitting and I get up, and pull the dog off of mine, and I guess me touching his dog didn't sit right, so he came over, and we had a little verbal confrontation, about me touching his dog, and this dude proceeds to lie and tell me my dog humps all the time as well and other things, etc. which then pissed me off even more. In the end, I sort of told him in simple terms to go fuck himself. I told him that my dog cannot even play in the dog park without getting relentlessly humped. I'm courteous enough to avoid these people at all costs, it's not that difficult. If I see them in the dog park I turn my ass around and we go for a hike. Do I deserve to get yelled at for doing that? There was another instance where this big un-neutered poodle did the same thing. My dog just stands there, he will sometimes try and get them off, but it's usually up to me or the other owner as I previously stated.  The dog was relentless, and all the owners did was sit on a bench and yell at the dog, which did absolutely nothing. So after about 15 minutes of this happening, I get up, walk over, and pull the dog off. I put one hand on the dog's collar, and another on the chest when pulling it off, in case it tried to bite me since I don't know this dog. The owner literally instantly gets up after watching me get up and walk over and do it and starts yelling at me and says something along the lines of if I do it again we are going to get into a physical fight to keep it simple. I'm a college student just trying to go to the dog park. Do I deserve to get yelled at for this? Am I the asshole in this situation? I just can't wrap my head around it, it seems so simple, yet some people are just so incompetent/incapable and I get yelled at for it.(all the dogs which hump my dog are not neutered, my dog is neutered)",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cycsji/humping_in_the_dog_park/

My wife wants me to bring the dog with me as she will be deploying soon and unable to take care of him. I can take him with me but he will be alone in a hotel room for most of the day besides weekends. 

Our friend who we got him from has offered to take care of him as well. They live in the country side and have about 4 other Pomeranians. To me it makes sense to leave him with them so he can have company besides being stuck alone most of the time.  

The problem is he doesn't seem to get along with other dogs. He will bark if they get too close to him, but he has never attacked another dog he runs away. When he was young a small Yorkie tried attacking him and I think that's why he's anxious with them. 

Would leaving him with people who are strangers to him and other poms be traumatic for him? He is from the same litter as the ones they have. Would he learn to get along with them? Our friends have years of experience raising dogs so I trust they'll know how to handle him.

1. Sleeping somewhere in the house other than our bed. In the 4 years we’ve had her, she suddenly sleeps in the basement or living room instead of with us. 

2. Super hyperactive - she seems like she has way more panic wild energy than before. It seems way more anxious than just playful energy. 

3. Snapping/chasing our cats- they’ve always lived well together but suddenly she is more interested in chasing them or snapping at them.

We currently feed him Blue Buffalo to which I understand isn’t very nutritional for dogs. He will only eat it when we add chicken and other meats, which is fine.

If there is another, softer form of food we can give him, please let me know. We don’t care too much about the price as we already spend a good amount on his kibble with chicken, but convenience would be something we are more inclined towards, so something that may have a storage life and easy shipping to our house would be great. Obviously, there is no perfect answer, but if you have a brand in mind, it would be greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cxoah9/changing_my_dogs_food/

PeachBananaYum,Breed Recommendation Help,3,2024-05-22 13:59:49+00:00,"**Introduction**

1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Not my first dog. I grew up with a poorly bred Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and a Husky mix, and as an adult I have owned an Old English Sheepdog/Border Collie mix (tended far more towards the OES). She was entirely trained and cared for by me but lived with my parents in her dotage as I unfortunately had to move into a rental flat.

2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I would prefer a breeder. It's important I find an animal with more expected attributes/attitude, and a puppy that I could raise to be around other animals peacefully.

3)Describe your ideal dog.

* GOOD WITH OTHER PETS. Biddable and willing to go on adventures/learn new things but able to chill out. Sweet natured, friendly and polite.

4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Smooth collies - I love the look of them and the descriptions of them that I've read online from owners and breeders. They are so stunning. And yourpurebredpuppy suggests that the traits they have are ideal for what I'm looking for. I've read that of the herding breeds, they are the least pushy with other animals. Unfortunately I've not met one in person as they are a vulnerable/rare breed here and most breeders are a considerable distance away. 

I have also looked into Goldens - they're super gorgeous and lovely dogs and I've never met a golden who didn't love everyone and thing around him. I love their versatility and willingness to please. Unfortunately I heard them once described as cancer machines and that has stuck with me.

5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic training, but also search and rescue and/or therapy dog work. My late Old English Sheepdog was a volunteer PAT dog who visited homes for the elderly and it was extremely rewarding for both she and I.

6)Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* See above - I'm not super into competing, but it could be fun to do some casual courses.

**Care Commitments**

7)How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Several hours a day for training/play/enrichment. Interaction would be basically whenever I am around which is 90% of the time.

8)How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1-2 hours on average, longer on the weekends and summer evenings. No dog parks, but we have plenty of woodland areas, beaches and greens near us where well-behaved dogs can play offleash.

9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Happy to brush every day and do some more involved grooming when required (nail clipping, ear cleaning, paw pad trims). Also very open to paying a groomer as and when needed.

**Personal Preferences**

10)What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium.

11)How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding is fine, barking I'd prefer less of but I can take excited barking as long as it's not constant. Slobber minimal.

12)How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I would really like to do this, but will obviously train strong recall before we even think about it.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* A little of both - err on the side of cuddly, but not an animal that will lose its mind if I'm out of sight.

14)Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please.

15)How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Someone knocking on the door or entering the yard - quiet caution. Greetings would hopefully be polite and friendly.

16)Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I would really rather not. My brother and some friends have dogs that we would be interacting with frequently.

17)Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* High prey drive - I have a cat and some smaller reptiles. I would like to avoid breeds that are prone to crazy separation anxiety as I already work from home, which I know means that training against separation anxiety is going to be important. Prevalent health issues - I just don't want to see an animal suffer or say farewell too soon.

**Lifestyle**

18)How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Weekly for no more than a few hours a day, and not every day. We do like to take daytrips occasionally, but have local pet-friendly friends if we intend to be away for longer than needed, and these will be eliminated if we get a puppy until the pup is older/more stable.

19)What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My housemate does not care. I would be fully financially responsible, but he is willing and able to be involved in feeding/walking (together with me)/training.

20)Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have two snakes and three lizards (all in enclosures) as well as a handful of invertebrates. Aside from 1 snake, they have their own room. Most key, I have a 6yo sphynx cat. He has not lived with a dog before, BUT he has interacted with dogs at length - he tends to be watchful but calm around them UNLESS they are rude about his space which earns a nose bop. He has cat trees and shelves around the house out of reach.

Most recently he interacted with my brother's labrador and great pyr (both under 2). First through a glass door and then in controlled person (both dogs leashed, cat given space to run). The pyr went fine, she had a little sniff and they ate together. He was wary of her size but there was no aggression on either side. The labrador was very interested in him - no aggression but she is boisterous and didn't respect his space, and she was bopped with a paw (no claws). He is overall quite confident.

21)Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Very occasionally if ever.

22)Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Rent currently, no restrictions.

23)What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* South UK. We have the dangerous dog ban (Tosas, Pits, Dogo Argentino, Fila Brasiliero and as of this year, the XL Bully). In truth, I have never seen one of these dogs in person.

24)What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Up to 30c in the summer, just below Oc in the winter. That's 86F and 36F for my non-metric friends.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25)Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* As mentioned above, I work from home with an occasional (read - once a month?) requirement to go into the office, but I can schedule that with my housemate who WFH once a week and works a weird schedule of sometimes 9-5, sometimes 1-10PM and often having Mondays and Tuesdays off. I do intend to take a few weeks off when we first have the pup in order to focus on acclimatising.

26)Feel free to ask any questions below.

What is the health/lifespan like for collies? I've been reading breeder records and they seem to be anywhere from 8-14 which seems pretty divided.

I'm happy to extrapolate on any of the information I've given.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cy0xsl/breed_recommendation_help/

mxtgitaa,Need advice on good muzzles,5,2024-05-22 07:51:24+00:00,"My dog will eat anything she can find on the ground. She does have a ""leave-it"" command but sometimes I'm not quick enough. Most things are pretty harmless like poop or a piece of bark, but she has gotten close to trying to eat a cane toad. Which makes me have to pay extra attention to everything she's sniffing and anything on the ground ahead when we're going on walks. I am doing my own research right now, but I was hoping to get some advice on good muzzles to use. She's a medium-size dog and we live in Australia so I'm after something breathable with pant-room that'll still stop her from eating off the ground. She will only wear it on walks. A muzzle with a leash attachment would be great to, as she has a harness at the moment and it can be difficult to control her considering she is also excitement reactive. 

I'm not sure how she'd take the muzzle, so if anybody could link an article for ex. on how to get a dog used to a muzzle that'd be great too!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cxut76/need_advice_on_good_muzzles/
CrizzleD-,Teaching a dog how to play gently (not with toys).,3,2024-05-22 11:36:56+00:00,"I adopted a ~10 month old basenji cross about 6 weeks ago. She’s a sweetheart, not aggressive at all, but as you’d expect she’s got a lot of energy (although we have trained her to settle in the evenings and she’s good in her crate). 

She loves food, balls, toys, and chewing. We play fetch (training with “drop it” and “leave it” is coming along nicely), and tug (again “drop it” is going well) and we made sure to get her some toys she can chew and others that contain treats that she has to get out. We also take her for walks, working on the pulling (when she gets excited about something). She knows “sit” (typical basenji with selective hearing though), her “stay” is awesome, her “lay down” is coming along nicely, and “paw” is her new command this week that she’s learnt quickly. All this to say she plays well with toys and has an outlet for her energy. 

But I’d like to be able to play with her without toys (I don’t know what to call it, play fighting or roughhousing??). I’ve had dogs before that I’ve adopted at an older age and once they trusted me, the play fighting just came naturally and they were really gentle. But I’ve never had a dog this young and I’m not sure how to *teach* them how to play gently but still enjoy it. You can tell that she kinda understands that she can’t bite you as hard as she does her toys, but we need to work on that. And she’s really chill about us touching her anywhere on her body, she doesn’t seem to give a shit, but whenever I engage in a little rough play she always goes to bite my arms (in a playful way, but a little too energetic and sometimes a bit too hard) and doesn’t seem to have any other way of playing. If I do the hand under the blanket playing she bites too hard (I don’t think she recognizes that as my hand). She *does* respond to “ouch” and pulls away immediately if she gets my skin while playing with a toy. 

I guess I just need a step by step from the beginning of how to teach your dog gentle play? Is this a good age to teach her? Anything else I should consider?

lindaecansada,Help with muzzle sizing ,3,2024-05-22 12:43:35+00:00,"Hello everyone! I've been looking to buy a muzzle for my dog. It's my first dog and our first muzzle so I tried buying it at a pet store to see it in person and make sure the size was correct.
The problem is I've been to all the pet stores in my city and they're always out of my dog's size.
I wanted to buy the Baskerville ultra muzzle size 2. They all say I need to pre-order it online.
The problem is that their sizing charts never match the sizing charts of the brand. The brand goes from 1 to 6 and the stores charts always go from XS to XXL which is not a problem within itself. But the measurements don't match. For example, size 2 is 6cm length and size S is 7,5cm length.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cxzbeo/help_with_muzzle_sizing/

cj_03,Potty trained dog poops inside everyday since I came home from college ,10,2024-05-22 10:23:31+00:00,"My 4-year-old border collie seems to be very bonded to my dad. She has completely synced her sleeping schedule to him, waking up at about 5am every morning and they go to sleep in his room at about 10pm. 

On the other hand, I’m on an opposite sleeping schedule and I go to sleep at 4am and wake up at around noon. During the hours that we’re both awake, I make sure to give her lots of love, attention and exercise. 

Here is the part that I don’t understand. Since my dog has developed this pattern of pooping inside while I’m asleep I’ve started setting an alarm so I can let her outside before she has an accident. I haven’t been able to catch her in time at all. It seems like she poops right after my dad leaves. I’ve talked to my dad and he says that we only have this problem when I’m living at home and the dog is not having accidents while I’m at college.  
If she has plenty of opportunities to go poop outside while she’s with my dad in the morning, why is this problem continuing to happen? 

When I discover that she’s had an accident I typically scold her by saying “bad girl poop outside” and show her the poop and after a few minutes I will say “say you’re sorry” and pet her for a bit.

",3,2024-05-22 04:26:46+00:00,"I have a four-year-old female APBT/Presa Canario mix that I've trained by myself and three different trainers for the last two years. I adopted her from a lazy couple who tried to keep her but weren't willing to be responsible and eventually gave up (they are why she has been challenging to train). She is very friendly to people, but prey drive is highly problematic whenever she sees any animal other than my other two dogs (I did an adequate job socializing them). These dogs are a female calupo (7y) and a male bullmastiff (5y) whom I've trained to be adequately obedient and nonreactive on a leash, and only needed minimal help from external trainers to get to this point. However, I trained and socialized them since they were pups. I'm not claiming to be the best dog trainer in the world, but I'm competent at training leash obedience and reactivity. However, I only had to deal with such high levels of independence and prey drive once I adopted this dog. I exercise her a lot through runs, bite work, the occasional treadmill, and obedience work, which is highly effective when she's at home. But the obedience work becomes completely useless once she is outside. For the past two years, I've struggled to reliably disengage her from other animals whenever she's outside. Two of my trainers used traditional methods, but they didn't work. She locks in at an intensity not even my calupo gets to. Then, another trainer tried using entirely positive training, but again, it would become useless once she noticed another animal. I've yet to progress in controlling her prey drive, even with daily exercise and training. She has been a perfect dog outside her problematically high prey drive. She is great at guarding and chasing coyotes from my ranch, an excellent pack member, and a great cuddle buddy. Even though many trainers have told me this problem might never change, I don't plan on giving up because I love this dog and want to take her on walks without her always going crazy at the sight of animals.

She will be normal all day until someone sits to eat. Panting, whining, pacing, jumping, she’s not a barker but she will bark if you’re not paying attention to her bothering you. 

What can I do? She will jump and claw at the door if we put her in a different room, if we block her off with a gate she does the same, just not jumping on us.

silver_ecstasy,My dog won’t play with other dogs when I’m around. Am I doing something wrong? ,1,2024-05-21 23:26:26+00:00," my dog refuses to play with the other dogs when I’m around. 

My dog, Rottweiler/ pit mix refuses to play with other dogs if I’m not outside with him. 

All together there are 5 dogs at my house, 3 of them are my parents. My parents have 3 archers of property so we usually let the dogs run and play all day. 

When I’m not home or at work my mom will let them out and he seems to play fine with the other dogs. 
When I’m home and I let him outside he just sits and stares off in the distance. Or he’ll just calmly sit at one of the doors and look through the window. 
If I leave my sliding to do my room open he’ll just come in and lay on my bed even if I’m not in the room. 

When I do go out side, he just stands by me or just waits or follows me around wherever ever I go. He is receptive when I initiate play with him. When the other dogs join in it’s like he gives up. Am I doing something wrong? 

He is a rescue dog. I think he is around two or three and I’ve had him for a year now. My other dog is a Belgian Malinois who is 1 1/2  and I’ve had him for almost the same amount of time. My mal plays well with the other dogs and is receptive to play.  Most of the other dogs are about one year old too so maybe my rottie/pit is just slowed down? 
We have a 12 year old hound mix who still really loves to play with everyone until he can’t keep up anymore and lays down lol. 

I don’t think this it’s a huge problem, I just feel bad that he acts kinda anti social when I’m around.  Is there something I can be doing better? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cxlzxl/my_dog_wont_play_with_other_dogs_when_im_around/

We adopted a lab mix in January, we've had him for 5 months. He can be a great dog, I know it but he just isn't with me. I am so committing to find a solution we have entered into dog training classes with him. But no matter what we do he still continues to bite me, nip me, hit me with his paws, jump up and punch me in the chest or stomach. He will destroy only my things if left alone. My whole office desk set-up  (mouse, mousepad, headset, misc. desk trinkets)has been replaced twice because of this dog, he even ripped apart a box of 250 save the dates. I can't even leave a room in my house without him doing one of the forementioned acts. The kicker is he doesn't do this to my fiancé or any other guest we have over.

I was in a sling for over two weeks because he bit and grabbed my wrist and wouldn't let go and used it like a toy that it injured both the short and long heads of my biceps brachii muscle. I was in 10/10 pain for weeks and I still haven't given up on my dog. 

Recently, my fiancé has been recovering from surgery so it's up to me to take care of the dog 24/7 and I think that's where all my frustration is coming to a head. The day in and day out acts of being bitten, jumped on and not listened to are taking an emotional toll on me, I have cried multiple times about the situation. I feel guilt because I don't feel a strong connection to the dog, I think I would if I wasn't handling so many of his behavioral problems constantly, but my fiancé loves him and the dog seems to love me. This dog is glued to me even if there are other people around or my fiancé is home. I want to love him and love having a dog but right now I just feel like I am running up against a wall.

We take him on one to two 2-3 mile walks a day, he goes out for off leash fetching the ball time 2-3 times a day.

ConsistentHouse1261,My review of Ruffwear Cooling Neck Gaiter vs Canada Pooch Cooling Bandana,5,2024-05-21 19:54:04+00:00,"So I thought I’d leave my review since it’s summer and I’m sure others are wondering what to try. I live in Michigan and the summers here are pretty humid. I know the cooling vests/accessories are not generally recommended for humid weather so I thought I’d first try the accessory items before the vest and see how it goes. 


Items:

https://canadapooch.com/collections/dog-cooling/products/wet-reveal-dog-cooling-bandana-scarf?variant=39961894158421


https://ruffwear.com/products/swamp-cooler-neck-gaiter


I personally like the Ruffwear cooling neck gaiter more. 

The one cool feature I liked about the Canada pooch bandana was that they had an option to buy a kind that changes from being a solid color when dry, to happy faces appearing when wet. This is a nice feature so you know when the bandana needs to be resoaked or just taken off if it’s dry and there’s no more water. 

Only issue is, i think i ordered a size too large. I ordered a medium for my Maltese mix dog who is 20 pounds. Should have stuck with a small. No matter how much i tied it, it fell off. I think it was too long for my dog so it bothered him when he walked. But I’m not even bothering to exchange it and the reason for that is, i don’t think a size small would have been useful anyway. Even if it stuck on to him, i don’t like the concept of the bandana as much as the gaiter. It doesn’t stick around him/his neck or chest enough to make a difference anyway. What’s nice about the Ruffwear gaiter is that it wraps around his neck so it stays in place against his skin and isn’t hanging out like a bandana typically does. If i wanted to cover the chest and back area that’s where a harness would come in handy. Neck gaiter i purchased in a size x-small by the way. Fits perfect. Their sizing runs differently since it’s a gaiter, not a bandana, so there’s more size options. 



Now the neck gaiter i think made an actual difference. Yesterday when i took my dog out in 82-85 degree weather, he wanted to go back inside within 5 minutes and ran for his life for water, understandably so. Today i put on the Ruffwear neck gaiter for the first time and he was able to have a typical 15-20 minute quick walk around our condo complex. He was way more relaxed coming back compared to yesterday’s walk. And both days have been just as humid/sunny at around the same time both days.


Now don’t get me wrong, i don’t think this gaiter would have been as useful in humid weather for long walks/walking long trails. Unless you had a ton of water to constantly re-soak the gaiter with, but that sounds too heavy to carry on such long walks. In dry heat I’m sure it’s more manageable. 

But this helped me decide to just go ahead and get my dog a cooling harness. I would be using it for shorter walks so I’m not worried about it drying up and making him hotter in the humidity. I don’t give my dog long walks if it’s that hot outside anyways, not worth risking it. He’s sensitive to heat as most dogs are. 

Hope this helped anyone who’s going back and forth about the humidity issue with cooling wear. As a bonus review, i got my dog one of the cooling toys from Canada pooch, specifically the dolphin. I believe there’s 4 different animal cooling toys. He’s obsessed with it and i haven’t even soaked it yet lol!!! 

I didn’t bother with the hat because i know he will get it off. Same with pavement boots. He would never allow me to get those on. I just avoid walks on pavement if it’s that hot. Luckily for me it’s easy to avoid since grass is right by my garage and door. 


I’m not interested in cooling vests since my dog is always leashed when outside (unless at dog park but still needs a harness between going in and out of park and car. He’s a puller so can’t use leash with his collar. 

I see that both Ruffwear and Canada pooch have a cooling harness but i think I’m gonna go with Ruffwear just because i know their material on the neck gaiter worked on my dog. That doesn’t mean Canada pooch material wouldn’t work, but i wasn’t able to test it out since the bandana design is flawed in my opinion. I’ll edit my review of the Ruffwear cooling harness once i have it. Hopefully it’s just as affective as their neck gaiter was for short walks.



TLDR: get the Ruffwear cooling neck gaiter over the Canada pooch cooling bandana in my opinion. Neck gaiter is a better design over a bandana. These items work fine in humid heat as long as it’s for short walks. Haven’t and wouldn’t try for long walks. I avoid long walks in high heat anyways, especially since it’s humid by me. Will try Ruffwear cooling harness next for the same purposes and edit this post with my review!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cxh2n8/my_review_of_ruffwear_cooling_neck_gaiter_vs/

kdahak,Rescue Dog Scared of Walks,1,2024-05-21 19:09:36+00:00,"Hi, reddit, first time poster here :)

My son and I rescued a small yorkie mix back in September of 2023, her name is Bonnie. She was found on the streets last summer and it's fairly obvious she was traumatized in some way. She is frightened by a lot of things- doorways, boxes on the floor, loud noises, the landscapers, etc. It even took me two months to get her to walk down the hall past the other apartment doors and I still have to carry her sometimes because she will refuse to leave the house by going through the doorway.

Due to her fears, whenever I take her for walks, she inevitably gets spooked by a car passing (she HATES the delivery trucks) or a branch getting stepped on and while I encourage her and wait with her until she calms down, she immediately wants to go back inside. We live in a major city, so I do not have a yard.

She also isn't playful. Sometimes she can be, but only play wrestling until I give her belly scratches. We have bought toys tried to interact with her to get her to play with us- nothing. She just relaxes all day on the couch of on her donut bed in the sun.

So this, coupled with her avoidance of walks, I feel like I am failing her. We love her. We adore her. We are completely obsessed. But I can't shake the feeling that she should be more energetic at the very least? Is this normal? I work from home quite a bit and the only time she gets excited is when she wants and is given belly lovins.

Is she getting enough exercise? Mental stimulation? Help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cxfzfr/rescue_dog_scared_of_walks/

Lonely-Back,"My 10 y/o Cavalier is Ruining my Relationship, help!",1,2024-05-21 16:01:28+00:00,"I (37F) started dating my boyfriend (35M) about 3 months. I struggled with dating for years and I finally met a great guy who cares about me and wants a future together. I had my Cavalier since he was 10 months old. I also have a German shepherd 10 month old puppy who loves my boyfriend. She can have her moments too, but it’s because she’s a puppy full of energy. He’s sweet as pie and for the most part behaves pretty well except for housebreaking rarely. He has a heart murmur and takes medicine. 

 Going back to my relationship, I sleep over my boyfriend’s condo over the weekends and this is when his behavior is at its worst. He has had multiple accidents even when we take him outside. I had to crate him again after years of not having the need. He starts panting hard to get my attention, if I pet him he stops, as soon as I stop, he starts panting like he can’t breathe. When we come back to his place, he’s peacefully sleeping and zero breathing noises. We followed all the advice about heavy panting and the only thing that works is you pet him, but we can’t pet him 24/7 obviously. Today was the icing on the cake, he peed on his crate early this morning when he peed outside late last night. He had no water after coming back from outside. It was at my boyfriend’s condo. His bed is a cool mat, so imagine the mess. I started screaming and crying of frustration. He pees out of spite and has done it for years every time I try to date. I can’t take this anymore. It’s the embarrassment, the constant cleaning, and what image am I giving to my boyfriend? He must think I won’t be able to handle kids. I tried to break up with my boyfriend because I can’t deal with the stress and my dog obviously wants me to die single. I got 2 dogs because I settled for dying single and never having a family before I met my now boyfriend. My boyfriend talked to me on not breaking up so we didn’t.

What can I do? I’m going insane! I don’t want to lose my boyfriend or my dog. I know it’s much easier to dump the boyfriend, but I want to settle down and I’m at that age where this might be my only chance.

Guilty_Jellyfish7858,Me and My Partner are Wondering What Dog Breed We Should Get,5,2024-05-21 14:25:20+00:00,"    We'd love to get some info on what you think the best dog breed would be for us, as we're not entirely sure yet, any input is more than welcome. 
    
    Also, sorry in advance for the amount of stuff i typed down, i saw that i was supposed to be specific, so i was, again, sorry. And thank you!
    
    **What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?** 
    
    * Honestly, I think we both love any kind of dog, but, i'll try to be more specific. I know that we both like retrievers, like the golden retriever and the labrador retriever, as they seem like the perfect blend of playful and friendly. We also really like spitz type dog breeds, like the shiba inu for example, this one is because, at least in my expirience, they seems like really intelligent, loyal and also kind of affectionate breeds once they get to know you better, plus, the shiba inu is pretty independent as well, which i think is a good thing since we both work full time jobs, allthough she leaves her workplace slightly earlier than me, about 30 minutes before i do. We also both have expirience with mutts, as we both grew up with family mutts when we were younger, and at least in our expirience, we both think that they tend to be very affectionate, and also incredibly hyper dogs.
    **What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?** 
    
    * I think the role i would like them to feel would just as a companion dog, you know, go on walks, run, play, bond, and all that jazz. That's pretty much it really, i'm sorry i can't be more specific but that's really all that we want lmao.
    
    **What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?** Have you been the primary caregiver of a dog before? If yes, what breed(s)? What is your experience with puppy or senior dog care?
    
    * As I've mentioned before, yes, I have had expirience taking care of dogs, as has my partner, i for one, have had 3 dogs during my life time, which can be sad depending on how you look at it, but the first dog lived all her happy doggo life, she was an amazing dog, but the second one, unfortunatly, had cancer, which again, unfortunatly was caught way too late, my family has a third dog now, which they still currently do. Allthough, as far as training goes, that's actually where I'm not as expirienced, since my first dog was from when i was but a child, and when i actually grew up to know that i was supposed to train her, she was already trained, i tried to train the second one, which seemed to be working, but again, things happen, and the one that my family currently has, I don't have much of a bond with, since I moved out 3 months after we got him. Anyway as far as being a primary caregiver, nope, I've never been the primary caregiver of a dog before, that's true for us both. In terms of what dog breeds we owned, the first one was a mutt, allthoug im pretty sure she was something of a chihuahua or something like that, since she was very small, but she was the sweetest little pupper so, yeah. The second one was a shiba inu, which i suspect might have had some golden retriever in him, but i'm really not sure, just a hunch, the third one is a husky. As for my partner, she's had a shiba inu as her first dog and a mutt as her second.
    
    **Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?** If so, what breed/type, age, and sex are they? 
    
    * Maybe a cat, we have talked about it, and we thought that it might be easier for them to get along if they were both introduced to each other at an early age, but that's not really something we're sure about right now, but for the sake of the argument, let's say that yeah, a cat.
    
    **Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?** 
    
    * No we do not have children, but we plan to have children in the future, maybe in about 3 years, as we have always dreamed of starting a family. We also do get our fair bit of visitors, but also not thaaaat often, maybe a couple times a week or once a month, depends really.
    
    **Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?** What type of building do you rent (condo, apartment, high-rise apartment, townhome, single-family home, etc)?
    
    * We are currently renting an apartment, i'd think we live in a fairly big apartment, not huge but, big i'd say. As far as i know the landlord doesn't really care what breed we have as long as it's not too loud as not to disturb the neighbours, which i get, honestly.
    
    **Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?** How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?
    
    * As of now, only me and my partner live in this household, and we're both gonna be responsible for it, and im pretty sure we're both giddy with excitement over getting a new pupper. As for as future kids, i mean, what kid doesn't like a friendly and playful doggo?
    
    **How often do you have visitors to your home?**
    
    * As i've mentioned, a fair bit, a couple times a week or sometimes once a month if evveryone's busy or something.
    
    **Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?** 
    
    * I wouldn't mind a rescue honestly, but my partner isn't so sure about that one, so we both agreed we would want to go through the process of finding a good breeder. Maybe one day we'll rescue one though, but as far of right now, she'd rather have a dog from that's still a puppy, since she wants to have the expirience of seeing the pupper grow up, which i can understand, and am fine with.
    
    **Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?** 
    
    *  As I've mentioned before, we'd want to get a puppy, as we want to see the puppy grow up, and have that expirience, since, like i said before, we were never the primary caregiver of the puppers we did have while growing up.
    
    **What size dog are you looking for?** [Here is a size chart for your convenience.](http://i.imgur.com/vnz3usJ.jpg)
    
    * After we saw the chart, we'd want a dog that would be taller or equal to a corgi, or at least that's what the dog looked like to us on the chart.
    
    **How much barking is too much barking?** 
    
    * You know the kind of dog that once they hear something outside, they go into a frenzy and don't shut up for the next excruciating minutes, that would be too much barking, obviously, most dogs are going to bark, that's only natural for them, but i'd rather ot have a dog would not shut up no matter what for hours on end basically, for the convenience of our neighbours.
    
    **How much regular brushing are you willing to do?**
    
    * That's not really an issue for us really, for some reason we both like brushing the dogs, at least for me, it's just really calming and  brings me to a meditative like state which is quite pleasant, so yeah. But i'd say that like once or twice a week, as we do like dog with smooth coats, don't know why, but maybe because of the kind of dogs we had while we grew up.
    
    **How much shedding do you think you can handle?** Some breeds of dogs shed more than others.  Some breeds don't shed, but require trimming or other coat maintenance instead.
    
    * I'd say we can tolerate a moderate amount of shedding, it's only expected, and we're not allergic to dogs in any way. but i'd also like to not go crazy cleaning everything and all the time, cause that would get old really fast, so yeah, moderate to low shedding would be ideal.
    
    **Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?** 
    
    * Yes to both questions.
    
    **How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?** 
    
    * Slobber is fine mostly i guess, somewhat gross i guess, too many farts are a no-no for my partner as she and her family have this crazy sensitive nose, and she will gag if it's a frequent thing.
    
    **How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?** 
    
    * Both are great personality traits to have, but maybe a mix of both i guess. Though i guess if i had to choose it would be eager to please but, again we both work, so maybe a mix of the two would be ideal.
    
    **What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?** 
    
    * i guess like positive reinforcement, obedience training or whatever it's called, socializing, leash training when we're walking around the streets, behavioral training if necessary of course, ya know, the usual.
    
    **Is there any behavior you can’t accommodate?** 
    
    * Well i guess this is a pretty straight forward answer, but yeah, aggression. I'm well aware no dog is inherintly aggressive and it depends on the way the owners train him and all, but I'd rather we have a dog that's just not as likely to be aggressive because, eventhough we have had dogs before, we were never really the ones that took care of them, so, i don't know i guess im kinda afraid that i'll mess the puppy up, or i'll do a mistake and bam now he's super aggressive. Maybe it's a irrational for me to think like that but yeah, it is what it is.
    
    **How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?** 
    
    * Fairly important, i'd say that's a quality for a dog to do so, since I did grow up in a village and, so far, all my dogs we're allowed to walk off leash for at least a good while, and they were fine, obviously we're now in a city and that's just not gonna fly but i'd like to let him roam a little when we're hiking or, idk in a dog park or something.
    
    **How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?** 
    
    * Well me and my partner as basically always available after 4 PM, so, yeah, i'd say we'd be able to easily give him exercise for like 4 hours, as we're both pretty active people.
    
    **How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?** 
    
    * Good question, i'm not interely sure how much mental stimulation they would need but i'd guess around an hour or like two would be good, but anyway that's all a guess, i'd try my best to give the dog all the physical and mental stimulation it would need, as would my partner.
    
    **Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?** 
    
    * At our apartment, and he would be able to sleep in our room, not necessarily in our bed, but in our room i guess.
    
    **How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?** 
    
    * 4 days a week for 8 hours straight, since my partner does have an 8-4 job, and i have a regular 9-5, but we do have a holiday one day of the week, so yeah, weekends are also available of course.
    
    **If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy day care, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?** 
    
    * Not really no, we would be able to come home during lunch as that's what we do anyway, as for the dog walker and all that, maybe sometimes? Definatly not all the time though.
    
    **What is the general location in which you live?** You can decline to answer, but responses will likely assume you’re somewhere in the US without breed-specific legislation (BSL).
    
    * We live in Portugal.
    
    **What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live? A typical winter day?** Please indicate Celsius or Fahrenheit and the climate of places you may likely live in the future.
    * Depends, but in the summer it seems to be around 20°C (68°F) to 30°C(86°F), but i've seen it get even higher like 50ºC, that was one time really. In the winter the average temperature would be around 8°C (46°F) to 16°C(61°F), but again i've seen it be a little lower.
    
    **On a scale of 1 to 10, how prepared are you to care for a dog and prioritize its well-being over your career, entertainment, or other life choices for the next 12 or more years?**
    
    * I can't say were 100% prepared, as I'm pretty sure we'd be considered begginner dog owners, but i'd say we are at least 7 out of 10 prepared, as far as knowledge and willing to prioritaze or doggo.
    
    **Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insuranc3?** 
    * Absolutely, that's rookie level critical thinking, of course we're well aware of the costs, and are more than prepared for them, as we've been saving up for a couple years, and we both have relatively good pay, so we won't run out of coal so to say, as in, we have our savings for the doggo if an emergency were to happen that we for some reason couldn't budget with our salaries each month, but we'd say we'd be able to budget the salaries for the doggo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cx961i/me_and_my_partner_are_wondering_what_dog_breed_we/

Where does that leave us in the immediate short term though? How / where should we be getting the puppy to sleep? Even if they pass out putting them back in the crate sets them off and wakes them up.

We are currently trying Blue Buffalo kibble and he refuses to eat it. My other dog (a male Catahoula) eats rice, freshpet, a small bit of kibble, and animal plasma, Plus whatever other meal toppers I add that day. Some days Barney will eat the freshpet. Some days he will not. Some days he will eat Kibble. Other days, not. He is so picky. I just don’t know what to do anymore.

Ophelious0918,My old dog suddenly refuse to go to her crate. Is this behavior normal ?,1,2024-05-21 13:47:11+00:00,"Some context: I had three Daschund. One of them grew old and die a natural death around two months ago. The remaining two are one 8yrs old female and one 6yrs old male. All of them are crate trained, I just need to call and they will go to their crate each night to sleep. 

For the last two weeks the female dog refuse to go to her crate, even if I have to drag her to her crate and lock it. She will whine a lot and jump around, wanting to be let out. I try to ignore her for one week and it’s still the same. She will settle down for a couple hour but will return to her whining. She never bark while inside her crate. 

She is in good health, eat well, play well only her sleeping has been an issue. I’m scratching my head here don’t know what to do. I will let both dog sleep outside their crate for today and see. But should I be worry because of this change in her behavior ? 

An additional note: it is raining season in my country so we have rain almost every evening now. It has never been a problem for her for the past 8 years we have been together thought.

isylph,Dog obsessed with new puppy,1,2024-05-21 09:53:31+00:00,"We just got a 6 month old cavoodle. Our existing 2.5 year old cavoodle is obsessing over the puppy, mainly in the evening. We walk them twice a day, I am
home all day, they come into the garden with me a few times a day. We have only had the puppy for one week but i’m afraid the behaviour will go on.

What has been happening is that the puppy initiates play and then the older dog goes into an intense mind zone, they play racing around for a while, but the older dog does not recognise when the puppy has had enough. He will stare at the puppy, trying to chase or wrestle, if they are lying down he will lick at the puppies face in an intense way or even paw at the puppy. The puppy is well socialised and playful and when it has had enough, it tries to stop the game, but the older dog thinks it’s just playing.

What I have done so far has been to hold the older dog back and stroke him. He keeps wanting to escape and struggles strongly to get to the puppy and stares at the puppy (which by now is stretched out and sleeping). So I hold him and stroke him and ask him a question he recognises like ‘are you thirsty?’. At some point you can see him jog out of it and get back to his normal self. He loses the intense look on his face and starts to look like himself again, yawns and start to relax. Then i can stop holding him back and just keep patting him to help him relax further.

Velvet_Trousers,Breed recommendations for 2nd dog for a single mom,0,2024-05-21 00:56:00+00:00,"
*Introduction**

I'm a current dog owner (7 year old maltipoo) and parent of an 8 year child. Amicably divorced and about to move to a new area and a bigger house with fenced in yard. I want to add a second dog to our family that's (Labrador to Great Pyrenees range) and will look intimidating enough to deter potential  human predators while still being gentle with me and my kid. Professional training is very important to me and will happen. See questionnaire below for more details.

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No. Currently own 7 year old maltipoo and had a medium sized rescue mutt previously, who passed away.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Since I have a child at home and may have another in the future, I prefer a reputable breeder at this stage of my life. Will rescue again when the kids in immediate and extended family are older.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* A dog that is laid-back, loyal, affectionate, trainable, and loves kids. Medium to large size. MOST IMPORTANTLY: I want a dog that will deter a potential predator (and by that I mean a human one) but is safe enough to have around my kid. Will protect us if anyone were to try to physically harm us, but otherwise is chill and trustworthy around my family. Not a hyper one that will destroy the house if it doesn't run a 10K every day (sorry Belgian Malinois).

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Shiloh Shepherds, Great Pyrenees, Newfoundland (although the drool is a turnoff), Staffordshire terriers (the smaller, stout UK version), Labrador, but want recommendations.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Walk calmly on the leash, alert me to people who enter the property, basic obedience training. I would take them to professional training classes, that's very important to me.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Not at this juncture although one day in the next 5-10 years I would like to get chickens or ducks so I would like it to be, if not an outright guardian, at least trustworthy around them (as in don't eat them).

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I work from home and have no plans to change that arrangement. Daily walks 1-2 times per day, play time at home, and outdoor hikes and excursions on the weekends. I would go to training classes as a puppy and as they grow up.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to large.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Moderate. I like a bark to alert me and a bit when playing but not more than that. I am fine with some shedding but excessive slobber, no.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It is important. I do want a dog that will be able to be trained to stay nearby and reliably return immediately when I call them.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggle bug.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My child is 8 years old and wans a calm, snuggly dog that will give her hugs when she's sad or scared and will make her feel safe and loved. Also will not pull on the leash too hard so she can walk them too. Assists in all aspects of dog care.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have one 7 year old maltipoo who loves other dogs. She lived with four other dogs when we moved overseas and had to wait to line up the paperwork for her to join us, so my friends took her in. She was part of the pack and she does seem lonely for an animal companion. She's got good manners and is a lovebug who alerts us to people, just in a tiny package.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Yes I currently rent and will for another year or two, no restrictions currently. Will get the  second dog after we move this summer so I will be choosing a place that allows a larger dog.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* UK. I believe they have some banned breeds but none of the ones I've been interested in so far are banned.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Cold and rainy in the winter, hot in the summer 90s F/30s C.

She’s ready to transition into adult food. I’ve always been a fan of science diet, but I’m not sure how I feel about their prescription diet chicken free recipes. It’s also insanely expensive. 

Wondering what chicken free food you feed your dog and do you have long-term experience with it?

I also prefer hard kibble - good for their teeth. 

I have a miniature pincher and I want to make sure she lives as close to 20 as possible and the most important thing I’m in control of is her food. There are a lot of brands out there that look promising but none of them have long-term studies done on their food. 
Anyway, if there’s any food in the US that you could recommend that you’ve fed your dog for over 10 years that is chicken free please comment below. Thank you so much!

AlexaDives,My dog (2-3 yrs) killed a baby bird (my fault). Should I be concerned? Is this normal behavior or something I should look into to train? ,1,2024-05-20 23:09:18+00:00,"I saw a baby bird fallen from a tree and I wanted to raise it to health so it can fly away on its own. 

I had an old parrot cage from a family friend I borrowed and put the bird in it. I guess the bars were a little too wide and it squeezed through. I saw it fall. My dog ran to sniff it. And left it alone. But as soon as it started to fail my dog bit it, picked it up and when I yelled to let go it was too late. The bird had a tiny hole and it’s guts slipped out and it bleed to death. 

I know my dog has prey -instincts and it’s my fault for getting an inadequate cage, but should I be concerned about my dogs behavior? She is a rescue. I want to know if this is normal and I should be more careful myself next time or if this is something I should look into for training.

She’s really mixed because she’s a sweetheart and just wants to be petted, an Angel with kids. But she makes me scratch my head with other animals.

Ok_Canary3870,Feeling Guilty About Communal Cremation,8,2024-05-20 20:52:07+00:00,"I lost my best friend of nearly 15 years a few weeks ago (would have been 15 last week). My father who my dog was registered under was ultimately responsible for the decision to put my dog down, although I would have agreed to this had I not been at work before he was at the vets. Whilst I got to see him at the vets, I didn’t get to seem being put down as I was calling other family. That’s one thing I already feel guilty about.

However, a communal cremation was agreed and whilst I would have gone with a private cremation I felt this was too late to change. I’ve only just found out today that you don’t normally get ashes back if your dog is communally cremated and I wish I had been told this and had more input, especially as I was closest to him and financially more suited to make the decision and I should have stood up for myself (worth noting I’m an adult living in the family home still). I just feel guilty and it already sucks my best mate is gone but now I can’t fulfil my late mother’s wishes of placing his urn in my dad’s grave, who wishes to be buried with my mother.

dumname2_1,Advice for helping dog thrive and get him outside his cage more?,8,2024-05-20 19:47:00+00:00,"First things first, I already took this guy to the vet, but they can't do anything for him for another 7 days, when we can officially transfer ownership.

I'll keep things brief because automod keeps catching my post. Feel free to ask questions if you have some. I've only had him for about two days now and he mostly just sleeps in his cage all day. His cage is left unlocked and is filled with bedding and pillows, so it's definitely comfortable, but I never had a pet willing to go in their cage like this. He goes on walks (only short walks until I see him getting healthier) and he'll go outside to use the bathroom, but besides that he just lays down sleeping. If he doesn't sleep he kinda just sits there and looks at me. Haven't tried giving him any toys yet but I feel like he'll just be disinterested. Trying to keep this as brief as possible so I can actually post, but if it ain't clear, I care a lot about this guy already and I'm trying to get him happy.

Edit: Now that I got through, lemme be clear and say he's been abused given by his scars and is clearly malnourished. Think he's just depressed cause of his life he lived. He's about two and is a medium sized husky mix.

Please note this is not my dog it is my in-laws dog, so I’m not his primary caretaker nor am I a dog person. I just live with them currently and I’m a bit worried about him. He goes to the vet often and is physically cared for, but I think he needs more attention than he’s getting, and I’m trying to change that but I’m not really sure where to start.

We took him to the vet he had a very small mass from licking that almost had to be removed, it has mostly healed and he was cleared to not need surgery but we just need to keep him from boredom licking so he doesn’t create more or worsen it. Vet gave no advice to the owners just told him not to let him lick. So here I am! He keeps trying to lick and I need help with this so he doesn’t hurt himself.

So far I have started taking him for actual walks, usually he’s just on a long tie out line so I thought change of scenery and more exercise could help. I am extremely sensitive to the heat though and it’s starting to get really hard for me to take him on as long of a walk as we were doing before as the heat increases. I try to play with his toys with him and he loves tug of war, but he stops after like 2 minutes and will just start licking his front legs? Not sure why he does that. I’ve also been trying to teach him tricks and give treats, but he only focuses on the treat.

ZebulonPike13,Looking for advice on best breeds for an apartment,5,2024-05-19 20:17:08+00:00,"So, I've been wanting a dog for a long time now. Currently I'm living in a small one-bedroom apartment, and I'm looking for a dog for companionship and for a reason to get out more. I've had dogs growing up, but I've never cared for one on my own, or in an apartment, so a lot of this is new to me. I've been considering a bunch of breeds but keep hesitating over certain details, so I would appreciate some help from other dog lovers to help me narrow down a breed.

Here's the questionnaire from the subreddit rules:

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* As stated in my intro, this will be my first dog I own on my own. When I was a kid we had an Australian Shepherd. She died when I was 12, after which we got a mini long-haired daschund. I helped quite a bit with training and walking/caring for her, but my parents did most of the work.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I think I would prefer to go through a breeder, but I'm not opposed to rescuing a dog if I find the right one. That being said, if I land on a specific breed I imagine going through a breeder would generally be easier.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* First and foremost, I want a dog that would be a loving and loyal companion. I figure this applies to most dogs, so I'm not too worried about that. I have nearby cousins with families, so they should ideally be good with kids, but they won't be around them all the time. I go hiking quite a bit, so I would love a dog that I can take hiking sometimes. However, keep in mind that I'm in a small apartment, so if they require constant stimulation and exercise that may be a problem. Lastly, I would prefer it if the dog wasn't a notorious barker. My apartment is on the ground floor and has pretty thin walls, so I imagine that there would be a lot to set off a loud dog. If it can be trained not to bark that might be okay, but I don't know how reliable that sort of training is.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* My top choice for a while has been a corgi - they're my favorite breed because they're so cute and seem quite friendly. However, after doing some research, I learned that they're some of the worst dogs when it comes to barking, which I cover my concerns with in my above answer. My second choice would be a long-haired daschund, since I have experience with them and know how great they can be. Again though, the barking may be a problem, and I'm not sure if they can reliably go on hikes.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Not planning on putting it to work or anything, I mostly just want a companion. I plan to train it to go on hikes and walks, and stay with me if we go off-leash. I have a dog park in my apartment complex, so it will need to behave well with other dogs. I'll probably play fetch with it a lot. Otherwise, I just want to do the standard stuff - sit, stay, come, as well as training it not to bark.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Nope, lol

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Depends on what's needed for the breed. I work from home, so I can probably dedicate a fair amount of time to training and caring for it each day. I'd prefer not to do more than two walks per day if possible, but do keep in mind that there's a nearby dog park that I can let it loose in.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Already partially answered, but I can devote a fair amount of time for exercise. The only problem would be forcing myself to be more active, lol. But two half-hour walks per day seems reasonable, along with the nearby dog park. I also try to go hiking at least once a week, so it would be nice to bring the dog with for that. If more is needed for the breed I would consider it, and if I get a puppy I also understand that it will require more attention and exercise to begin with.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I think I would prefer a dog which requires less grooming, but I'll do what's needed. I'm fine with brushing a dog every day as long as it doesn't take too much time. Same with other grooming, but if a professional is needed every once in a while I would also consider that.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Small to medium, don't want a huge dog taking up too much space.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding: Hadn't really considered it - I guess less is better. Worst case scenario I may need to vacuum more often. Barking: already detailed a lot, I don't want a dog that constantly barks. If it can be trained to bark less I would consider it. Slobber: probably not an issue, but like shedding, less would likely be better.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* My city allows dogs to be off-leash on certain hiking trails, so that would be nice. But if it's not advisable I'm okay with keeping it on a leash

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* The snugglier the better

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Either way is good as long as it's friendly. I imagine an eager-to-please dog might be easier to train.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I don't get a lot of visitors, but again, I'd prefer it if it wouldn't bark a lot. A friendly reaction to strangers and visitors is preferable, but I don't really care as long as it's not aggressive

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I'm gonna say no. There's a lot of dogs in my apartment complex, plus I have family in the area who has dogs, so it definitely needs to get along with other dogs.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I think I've detailed most of my preferences. Excessive barking would be an issue, as would aggression, but otherwise I'm open.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I don't usually leave the apartment for too long since I work from home, so usually no more than a few hours at a time if I have errands to run. Occasionally I may take a day trip somewhere where I may be gone a bit longer. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone at the moment, so it would be just me

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No other pets, not likely to get other pets while I'm living in this apartment. I may consider getting a cat or another dog if I move somewhere else, though.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* My cousins have kids. I don't see them regularly, but I do visit them about once a month or so. Their houses can get quite chaotic, lol

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent. No weight restrictions that I could see, but here's a list of breeds not allowed:
* Akita
* American Staffordshire Terrier
* Bull Terrier
* Chows
* Doberman
* German Shepard
* Husky
* Pit Bull
* Presa Canario
* Rottweilers
* Wolf Hybrid

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I live near Denver, Colorado. Not sure of specific restrictions, but I doubt there's anything not listed from the above question

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Average temps for summer are 89° / 59° high/low (Fahrenheit). For winter, average temps are 47° / 22°. In summer I've seen it get as high as around 100, in winter it can get as low as 0 (quite rare, though). In winter it snows at least once a month, sometimes once every few weeks.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I think I've been pretty thorough, but if anyone needs more info feel free to ask and I'll reply.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

Just this: for apartment dwellers like myself, what is your experience with owning dogs? How does it differ from raising a dog in a house with a yard? What issues did you run into that you wish you would have known before getting a dog?

Thank you in advance! Hopefully this will ease some of my fears and concerns. I just want to make sure that my dog will be as happy and healthy as possible before I dive into this responsibility.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cvxacu/looking_for_advice_on_best_breeds_for_an_apartment/

    10)	What size dog are you looking for?

    Medium - large

    Used to shedding, would prefer less barking and minimal slobber

    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

    Would love to be able to let them run on country walks but will depend on recall. Not a deal breaker if can't

    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

    Snuggly 

    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

    We both work from home most of the time, I go to the office 2 days per week and husband works away usually no more than 1 week per month. The days I have to go to the office while husband is away I would look at doggy daycare, would probably look to do this regularly when not needed to reduce separation anxiety. Maybe once every couple of months 4-6hrs in the evening for social events that aren't dog friendly but we would be home all day before this and look to tire out before we leave ( not while still a puppy) 

    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

    We both want a dog and want to be involved have the same expectations for behaviour and training

JustAGoose21,Fresh Food Advice,1,2024-05-20 04:56:42+00:00,"First, some context. I’ve had my rescue pup for almost two years. For the entire time I’ve had her, she’s never been food motivated. Treats? Yes. People food? You bet. But when it comes to her food, she isn’t interested. She’s extremely finicky about keeping weight on, and I’ve tried to feed her on a schedule to keep track of how much she eats. I’ve added Instinct toppers and salmon oil, and tried a dozen other things to try and get her to eat all her food in one go. She always watches me make her food, runs to follow me to where I keep her bowls, scarfs down the topper bits, and then grazes on the kibble for the rest of the day. It normally takes her just about the whole day to finish what should be “breakfast”. Sometimes she’ll randomly eat all of what’s left in the bowl (like she’s starved) but when I make her her her second bowl for the day, she goes back to not being interested. 

All this to say, I want her to start eating more consistently (and more in general). I want to start her on fresh food l, but am unsure which brand. I’ve looked into FreshPet but have heard some not-so-great things. So any advice on fresh good brands, or really anything that could help me get her on a more consistent eating schedule, would be immensely appreciated.

WillyK19,Am I giving my chow enough attention? ,26,2024-05-19 17:51:47+00:00,"Am i giving my chow enough attention?

Since last week we have a chow living with us. 
My parents had 2 chows and they started fighting more and more with each other over the past weeks so they decided to split them.

One is still living with them and one is now living with me (and my brother and sister) 
I personally feel guilty towards the dog for thinking that i dont spend enough time with her. 

She is almost 6 years old and am energetic chow who does not really love attention. 

Her days now look like: 
- I walk with her before going to work at 5 am (we walk 40 minutes)
- after the walk she goes in the garden for a minute until i leave for work round 5:50 am 
- my sister lets her in the garden again between 6:45 and 7:30 then she leaves for work.
- my sister gets back from work around 5 pm and lets her in the garden again 
- i come home around 6 pm and walk her then for 20 minutes 
- my sister is then at her horse when we get back and i leave for a training session (7 till 8 pm), she gets to spend the evening in the garden until i come back around 8:15 pm
- then we go for a walk again for 20 minutes 
After the walk we play a bit and then it is bed time for me, my sister is then just back home and plays a bit more with the chow before going to bed around 10 pm.

It sounds like enough attention but she keeps looking at me with the big sad eyes! 

In the weekend we add an extra walk to the list because we have more free time. 

What do you all think?

shakespearest,Breed reccs 💓,10,2024-05-19 15:46:08+00:00,"Hello all! 

My family and I recently lost our elderly Yorkshire Terrier, and I’ve been researching the best breed for a future prospect. Our Yorkie was 10 when we got her, and lived to 18.

I’m a sighthound lover but I don’t think they’d be best for my family’s wants and needs- although possibly a whippet. 
Also interested in wire dachshunds. 

**Introduction**

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
This will be my family’s second dog, but I have worked with dogs for years in daycare, rescue and now grooming. I have a dog first aid certificate and a dog behaviour qualification, I’m pretty savvy. 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder
Open to rescue, feel a scruffy terrier mix could work but as my family aren’t as savvy I’d prefer very little reactivity and fearfulness which is rife with rescue dogs near me. Also, if I was opting for a Dachshund for example, I’d want to be sure it was raised in ways that will lessen chances of IVDD, and socialised properly, neutered after 1yo etc etc. So may depend on breed. 

3) Describe your ideal dog.
We’d like a happy, sociable dog who’s pretty biddable, able to go off lead and interested in some trick learning. Good off switch, happy with 1-2 hours adventuring a day and snoozing in the evenings, preferably not overly intense or drivey, and minimal prey drive. Preferably not brachy or bully. 

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
I’d love a whippet for the family, but they prey drive and recall might be a barrier, and my dad isn’t a huge fan of their looks. 
I think a wire Dachshund would tick most boxes, but the health issues worry me!
Working cocker could work, but a LOT of dog there! Same with a JRT. 
A poodle (mini or toy) would be amazing but the grooming upkeep is a lot! 

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
Lots of functional training - loose leash, settle, not door dashing etc, plus lots of fun party tricks essentially. I really enjoy teaching ‘play dead’ and things of that nature. Would love to do agility. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
Not experienced but I’d be interested in agility, dock diving, Confo. 

**Care Commitments**
7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
Training could be 10-60 mins, play time and enrichment as needed really. My parents are retired and quite old but pretty active, and can be home most of the day, the dog is also welcome to join me at the grooming shop where dogs would be in and out all day. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?
 1-2ish hours daily, walking, possibly agility/ dock diving, in England ‘dog parks’ aren’t really a thing, but pup would be likely to run into off leash dogs on walks. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?
Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
No double coats please! I’d rather it not be a dog with long hair that needs brushing every day or two- would much prefer a smooth or wire coat. 


**Personal Preferences**
10)
What size dog are you looking for?
X Small to Medium. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
Minimal shedding, minimal barking, no slobber! 🙈

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
Like 7/10 important, would be heavily preferred. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
Snuggly and pretty Velcro but happy to be left alone. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that's more eager-to-please?
Eager to please is preferable. 

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?
Not really, but happy to work on this in training. Not a huge deal one way or the other. 

How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?
Anything from aloof to friendly.


16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
No. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can't deal with or want to avoid?
🤔
 

**Lifestyle**
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
Mostly this won’t be necessary, but they should be able to be alone comfortably. At most it’d likely be 3/4 hours or so. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?
Mostly like scruffy ungroomed things. I prefer sighthounds but again, probably not the best fit for everyone! Two brothers who mostly just want a fuss sometimes, parents who will do most of the walking and me who will be more on the grooming, training, activities side. I’m the youngest and I’m 26. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal = they?
I have two guinea pigs, but they may not be here when this happens. They’re locked in my room at almost all times. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
No. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
 House is owned. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
 South East England, the banned breeds are bully breeds.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
Summer 25-30Cish, winter 0-7ish?

Wikeni,Muzzle to prevent foraging?,49,2024-05-19 11:46:55+00:00,"Wasn’t sure how to tag this. Thanks for any tips!

My dog knows “leave it” and “drop it,” but sometimes still forages and gets stuff like bones from the grass at my complex so quickly, before I can even see anything there. Like he’ll be mid-stride, dip his head and suddenly crunch something. The times I’ve been quick enough he’ll follow my commands and spit the bone out, and I’ll kick it away out of reach of everyone’s pets, but sometimes, like I said, he’s quicker. I imagine it’s an issue for others’ dogs, too, since I’ve seen bits of bone and snacks on the walking path. 

Anyway, I’ve been toying with the idea of getting him a muzzle that doesn’t allow him to forage. I don’t want people to be scared of him, but it’s better than him continuing to get scraps. Sometimes, raccoons or other critters drag stuff out of the trash bins, but people litter, too, sadly. I’ve found food and trash left out from people barbecuing/partying/picnicking in the community areas around the paths. There’s a bigger issue, too.

Recently, there have been a lot of chicken wing/drumstick bones scattered on the front lawn of the apartment across the breezeway (or “next door” if you’re looking from the lawn). There are construction guys in there fixing the place up (long story), and although I can’t point fingers, I have a feeling they’re tossing chicken bones from their lunch out on the lawn - I’ve seen them eating out on the patio a few times. I’m intending to bring them some peace offering snacks and ask them politely that IF it is them, to please throw the bones in the bushes to the side, instead (I won’t point out that they have about 8 open trash bags in there 🙄). 

Still, it’s my problem, and it won’t necessarily go away because they’re not the only ones doing it, just the most egregious at the moment. 

Would a muzzle be cruel? Any recommendations? Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cvmfs0/muzzle_to_prevent_foraging/

Just some background: this is a rescue I found on the highway during a road trip. I have had her for a couple months now. She is not spayed it seems like as the vet says she has definitely had puppies. No prev owner found. No chips etc.

Shapeshift-Alt-Tab,Opinions on changing the name of a shelter dog and how to go about it ,7,2024-05-18 12:42:26+00:00,"Hello all

My partner and I are currently in the process of adopting a young staffie (mix). We are now working on responding to our voices and things are going great. She doesn't really react much when calling her by her name, only a little.

The thing is, her name is awful and doesn't fit her type of dog at all: Gucci.

We are currently calling her something that resembles Gucci phonetically and translates to ""little cow"" in my native language. That's cute but a little ridiculous as an official new name.

So my questions are:

What are your experiences and/or opinions on changing the name of a shelter dog? 
Do you think the new name has to be similar to the old one? 
How do you go about teaching the dog a name that sounds completely different?
And would you tell shelter staff so you can start practicing while the dog is still in their care?

Is there even a nice name that resembles Gucci anyway!?

maltese_sheep,How to Exercise an Aussie That Hates Repetition?,23,2024-05-17 22:54:44+00:00,"Hey guys! I have an aussie mix, Finn, that I adopted almost two years ago that I'd really like to enrich the life of. He'll be 5 in August and he's got energy for days and I've never really been able to mentally or physically exhaust him. His favorite thing in the world is going on long forest/mountain trails. He has his nose to the ground and loves to show us where the trail is. During fall when the leaves are covering the less-used trails he's actually quite useful lol. However, there really aren't any good, difficult mountain trails in our area that I can really get him exhausted on jumping up the rocks and such.

I originally adopted a herding breed with the intention of doing frisbee, agility, and a bit of obedience. However, Finn very much dislikes repetition. He's extremely treat-motivated but he mentally checks out once it's no longer exciting. He'll fetch the ball/frisbee a couple of times and that's it. He'll do the jumps a few times and then wander off. The best activity I have found for him is playing hide-and-seek with a treat either inside or outside but he gets so excited he tends to start gagging and choking on the treats after about 5-10 minutes of playing.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can help enrich his life? I'd love to tire him out but I really don't know what else to try. He likes puzzle toys and snuffle mats and anything involving treats but those don't seem to really tire him out.

Did you go through a tough breakup, and then find comfort in the snuggles of your loyal pup? Have you struggled with anxiety or depression, and found solace in the unconditional love of your dog?

He was super scared and trembling, so I gave him some food and water and a blanket and let him be for the night.  The next day he let me pet him and I looked him over and he looked like he was in good shape.  Not skinny, not dirty, not hurt, so I figured he had an owner so I set out to see if I could find them.  I should mention that I live close to two very busy streets and just a few blocks from a third very busy street, so I didn´t think he could have gone far.  I walked around the neighborhood to see if someone had put up a poster.  But nothing.  So I decided to offer him for adoption.  But the people who replied kind of gave me a bad vibe and by then I had gotten attached to him.  Took him to the ver for a checkup and shots and the vet agreed that he didn´t look like he had been a street dog and that he was about 2 years old.  I gave him a name, and he learned it right away and would come when called.  He will come when called even when he is doing something he likes, like playing with a toy or look outside from the gate.  But, when I try to put him outside for a short time, like if I need to mop, he will not stay outside.  He will also not stay put if he is on the bed and I am just going to the bathroom.  He is a good boy, goes outside to poop, doesn´t destroy things, so I am sure he has had some training at some point, but I don´t know how to get him to mind.

- She picks the puppy for me based on my needs and experience.

- Only have one litter in a year

- I was able to met one of her previous puppy’s owner and the dog itself and I had positive expereience.

- Parents have been proved in work

- Puppys socialized to other animals, children, noises, car…



Orange/Red flags

- No special contract, just the fact of ownership change

- It’s her 4th litter only

- Mother only have DCM1,2 vWd, HIP, ED tested. (Not tested for eg:Autoimmune thyroiditis)



I don’t how to decide. I spoke and met a ton of fci registered dobi breeder, and so far she came out on top base on the green flags I wrote and the fact she did not try to persuade a dog on me(Even breeders with 30yrs of known experience tried to talk me in to their dogs), but also looking at her “by the book” not everything checks out, and I am super worried, cause in the past I have been screwed by reputable breeder with intentionally hidden genetics problem with forged health tests, so I am super suspicious with everything and looking for every possible red flags I can.

However, someone that is CRITICALLY important to this decision is my parents' 2 1/2 yo GSD. For context, I completed a masters over COVID, and helped raise her while I stayed with my parents to finish up my degree. In fact, calling her my ""parents' dog"" feels a little incomplete — I live \~10 min away, we take regular walks together, she has stayed with me, we spend weekends together regularly, and I am one of ""her people.""

Given the involvement of this dog in my life and the amount I care for her role in all of this, does anyone have any strategies for how to factor her into the decision? My two main options are the adoption/shelter route or her breeder (who's also involved in the animal welfare community and been validated as a responsible breeder by one of our friends who run a local shelter). Just kind of trying to weigh the pros/cons of both options before I commit.

Apprehensive_Pie4498,Toy and crate suggestions ,0,2024-05-17 02:49:26+00:00,"Hi! We recently rescued a new dog, we believe he is a border collie GSD mix (Shollie) but are waiting on his Embark results. He is, of course, the smartest dog we’ve ever had. He also has separation anxiety, which after only two weeks is super understandable, since he spent two months in A high kill shelter and was found as a stray. He was a volunteer favorite hence why he got to stick around so long. We homeschool so I’m home with him and his human, furred, and feathered sibling 90% of the time. The first time we were away he figured out how to get out of his crate and open all of the gates we have in the house. Luckily no real damage done. We put some locks on his crate today and he damaged one and also got through the bottom of his crate and pulled the rug that is under his crate up and started shredding it. We cannot afford a 2k impact crate so hoping for to find a more affordable alternative, as well as enrichment toys to keep him busy. I had a few stuffable rubber toys in his crate with just treats in them that he has had no interest in. I’m wondering if you think doing the frozen kong treats would help or any other recommendations for a dog that prefers fabric toys but cannot be left alone with them without eating them?

BodyBy711,New CDC regulations for bringing dogs into the States,61,2024-05-16 22:17:59+00:00,"Hello fellow dog owners,

Thought this info might be worth a share (I'm sure the mods will delete if deemed unsuitable for this sub).  The CDC is making changes (effective August 1st) on what you need to be able to bring a dog into the States.

As a Canadian with a yurt booked on the Washington coast in September, this has complicated our travel plans (my dog is microchipped and healthy, it's just seemingly a buttload of paperwork now to get him in).

Thought I should mention in case anyone else has an US-destination vacation booked with their pooch for after August!

Competitive_Fact6030,Breed recommendation,2,2024-05-16 22:14:22+00:00,"**Introduction**

    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * I have had family dogs all my life, but this would be my first one living on my own. I have reasonable experience with training and owning dogs. I also have a pretty good grasp on puppies as my mother has bred dogs (ugh, i know)
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    * Likely going to adopt from someone who needs to rehome their dog. Alternatively a breeder. There arent really rescues in my country. I would like avoid adopting a puppy, and instead would prefer a 1-2 year old. 
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * A small/medium dog that is social and cuddly but not overly clingy (basically they just need to listen to the command ""go away"" soemtimes haha). Not extremely high energy, but still eager to play and maybe come with during runs. A mild temperament and easily trainable would be ideal. Good health condition is very important (a mutt is fine). No vocal breeds as I would live in an apartment. 
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * No particular breed in mind (that is kind of what i need help with lol). I do love setters since one of my family dogs is a Irish setter/golden retriever mix and she is pretty much my ideal dog (although she does not do recall well, which is a concern).



    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * Basic commands like sit, lie down, go away, etc. Recall would be a huge plus. Would need to be trainable to ignore/be calm around other dogs and stimuli on walks, and be able to walk nicely on a leash.  
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    * No.
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * I'm away from home a maximum of about 6 hours a day, mostly way less. I'm a student and I spend a lot of time at home studying and doing other things, which means I do have time to be around the dog.
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * I plan on doing shorter (~15 min) walks in the morning and at lunch time, and a longer walk in the evening. I would be able to visit a dog park/open area for running (when the dog has learnt recall) about twice a week. I do also run occasionally, and in the fall/spring im happy to take the dog with me.
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * Im happy to keep up with brushing weekly or so. Im comfortable bathing and trimming nails on my own. Im only interested in dogs with a ""normal"" coat that does not require frequent grooming visits. Im not willing to pay for the normal grooming fees like brushing, bathing, or trimming.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * medium 15-40 lbs. A small is also acceptable depending on the breed, but i do prefer medium as they seem like the most athletic size and are able to go along on hikes and stuff. 
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    * Preferably no barking as id live in an apartment. Shedding is fine as long as its not excessive as i am slightly allergic. No slobber.  
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    * Relatively important. I do want to be able to let it run free for playtime, and hiking in the woods off leash would be great. So a dog with good impulse control that doesnt just run off the second it gets off leash would be great.  
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    * Somewhere in the middle. I do really enjoy cuddling with a dog and having them sleep in my bed, but i also dont want it to be too in your face. Basically just a dog that says hi then settles down with me instead of constantly seeking attention. 
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    * eager to please 
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    * friendly to visitors 
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    * preferably no aggressive dogs. I would like to be able to safely let the dog be off leash without any fights. I'd rather not take the risk of my dog hurting another dog/person. 
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    * Poor recall. Also howling/barking when im not home. I would like to trust my dog to be relatively quiet when im not there. Destructive behaviour like chewing up furniture even as an adult would also be a big no. 
    
    **Lifestyle**
    
    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
    
    * up to 6 hours a day. In the future that could be bumped up to 8-9, but I will always be close to home, so a quick walk during lunch would be possible. 
    
    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
    
    * I live alone
    
    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
    
    * Possibly going to get a cat in the future
    
    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
    
    * no
    
    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
    
    * I will rent a student apartment. There are no limitations on pets and there is no extra fee or cost to having one. 
    
    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
    
    * Sweden, no current breed restrictions but there is talk of banning certain bully breeds unfortunately. 
    
    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
    
    * Summer would be ~20 C (70 F), whilst winter averages around -20C (-4F). The hottest it gets is 30C (85), and the coldest is -30C (-22F).

sportyphysicist,prevent snakes in yards,49,2024-05-16 18:25:18+00:00,"We're moving to our first house (and first yard!!!!). I'm so excited for our boys- 11 yo yellow lab and 10 yo chocolate lab. For those with a yard, I have a question. Do you do anything to prevent snakes from coming into your yard? Ours is fully fenced, with all but one side being a privacy fence. There is a raised deck that's open underneath. This is mainly where I'm concerned about. Our chocolate lab is wayyy too curious for his own good and I'm concerned he'll get bit if he tries to investigate a new critter he's never seen.

For reference, we're in a suburb of Atlanta (GA, USA). I grew up in Alabama and have had several close run ins with copperheads in (city) back yards, which is where my anxiety about this comes from.

Any thoughts, comments, suggestions are greatly appreciated!

Kronephon,Eurasier / Labrador / Collie / American Shepeard? Can people who know these breeds opine? Thank you.,11,2024-05-16 17:06:00+00:00,"***Introduction***

1. *^(Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?)*

No, I grew up with labradors and had a portuguese podengo when I was in high school.

1. *^(Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a)* [*^(reputable breeder)*](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)*^(?)*

I'd like a puppy to be honest.

1. *^(Describe your ideal dog.)*

Chill indoors. Active outdoors. Likes day long hikes. Will run with me (the ocasional 5k once a week usually). Biddable and trainable. Low/no barking (I live in a apartment). Medium to large dog. No agression. A warning bark is ok. Can be left alone for some hours.

1. ^(What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?)

So I'm quite partial to the **eurasier** as it fits what I described above really well, but I'm scared that they might not be trainable to the extent that I want (ie. come when I tell them to come and ignore the fox or the squirrel).

Alternatively I've looked into the **labrador** but I'm concerned over all the health issues this breed has, On top of this their indoor activity level (I would like to both crate and leave the adult dog alone for periods ranging from 1 to 8 hours) seemed to concern me.

I've looked also into the **rough/smooth collie** and they seem really good fit also but since I'm in an apartment, I'm concerned over barking.

Also looked into the **american sheperd** but the energy level seems to be too high (I was looking at providing the adult dog between 1 and 2 hours of daily outoor exercise).

1. *^(What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?)*

Obedience and little more. Might do agility for fun but for day to day I need obedience training to be able to off lead the dog.

1. *^(Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally)* *or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?)*

Only recreationally, I be keen to do agility.

***Care Commitments***

*^(7)* *How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?)*

Like I said above, I'd be keen to do between one hour to two of walking outdoors which include training exercises but also running etc. On top of this indoors I also wish to interact with the dog whenever I'm there. It would be a family member.

*^(8)* *How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?)*

1 to 2 hours a day for the routine, ideally ponctuated with much longer hikes/runs on a weekly basis. Free-lead walks, tug of war, training, retrieving/fetch, running with the dog.

I'm not sure I would take my dog to the dog park. I'd rather have him lead-free in a normal park.

*^(9)* *How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?)*

1x a week brushing. More in shed season maybe.

***Personal Preferences***

*^(10)* *What size dog are you looking for?)*

medium to large

*^(11)* *How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?)*

Shedding I can handle fine.

Barking not so much - I live in a apartment.

Slobber I wouldn't like.

*^(12)* *How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?)*

Important. I plan to take my dog on hikes and to the park where he could walk with us. I'd like to only use the leash if we're going around traffic.

***Dog Personality and Behavior***

*^(13)* *Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?)*

Both to be honest. I prefer a dog that is usually ok by himself but will ocasionally want to to snuggle.

*^(14)* *Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?)*

Trainability is important to me as I need him to have a good ""Come"" ""No"" ""Sit"" and ""Enough""

*^(15)* *How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?)*

No agression. A warning bark is ok.

*^(16)* *Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?)*

I am willing to the extent that I'm going to socialise the puppy as much as I can to prevent this.

*^(17)* *Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?)*

No agression.

***Lifestyle***

*^(18)* *How often and how long will the dog be left alone?)*

One of us works from home and I work 3 days a week at the office. I expect that the dog will be routinely left alone something between 1 to 4 hours a day with the rare 8 hours where neither of us are available.

*^(19)* *What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?)*

We both want a dog. We both wish to be involved.

*^(20)* *Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?)*

Nope. We might consider getting another dog a year later and maybe a cat down the line.

*^(21)* *Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?)*

Not regurlarly. Just at the park or when we visit family.

*^(22)* *Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?)*

We own.

*^(23)* *What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?)*

London. Dangerous breeds are banned but that's about it.

*^(24)* *What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?)*

23C (73.4) for summer. 3C (37.4) for winter.

I often  opt for the frisbee instead because I know tennis balls aren’t great for them (and we limit fetch anyway for a few reasons) but she loves tennis balls more than anything. I have tried the chuck it balls and despite being a fetch addict she won’t play with them. I think it’s because she gets super excited, drools, and then can’t hold on to them plus isn’t a fan of the texture.

SnooFloofs373,Help us find our dog: active family needing an emotional support dog [breeds],10,2024-05-16 16:06:40+00:00,"I’ve been spinning in circles trying to find the best breed for us. The short intro: my son really wants/needs an emotional support animal to help him cope with severe anxiety by having a calm friend to sit with. But we are also an active, busy family that wants a fun friend that is not too much work or that costs a ton for grooming. 

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be our family’s first dog. My wife grew up with dogs in her home. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

No preference, but looking for an adult dog that is already somewhat well behaved. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

A dog that can primarily be a companion for my so , but also an active friend for the whole family. We are busy and don’t have a lot of extra money, so we are trying to avoid a dog that requires extensive grooming or high cost professional grooming every month. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

We have considered the doodles, labs, golden retrievers, havanese. My son loves the look of Samoyeds and Bernese Mountain Dogs but recognizes they might be a good fit for us. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

No extensive training other than being a calm companion for my son at times. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

All together, we have 1-2 hours a day for active engagement with the dog, many more hours for snuggling

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

1 hour. We live near two dog parks and also like to go for walks and jogs, if the dog can handle running. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We can handle brushing multiple times a week. We can do basic trimming and grooming at home but would likely need a professional grooming for more extensive jobs. We are open to paying, but don’t want to have a pay hundreds a month for grooming. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Small to medium. My wife wants a dog she can pick up if needed. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

We are open to all of these things, but would prefer as little as possible of each. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Would be helpful, but not required. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please

No preference. Don’t need or want protection.

No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

No

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

There may be one day a week where the dog would be alone for 4-5 hours. Other than that, we may all be gone 1-2 hours a day. I work from home most days and could be around to take care of the dog, but not necessarily actively engage all day. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

All will be involved with the dog, my son wants a calm companion. My daughters want a dog to play fetch with. My wife wants a low maintenance dog. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

None

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes: three kids, ages 12, 12, and 9.

SishenShunsui,[Breeds] Please help us decide an appropriate breed.,6,2024-05-16 14:49:35+00:00,"Can you help our family choose a dog? [Breeds]

We are a family of 3 with a 2 year old boy. We are finally settled in our new home and we are ready to add a dog to our family. 


 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* We grew up with dogs but it will our first time as the primary care givers/ trainers.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We would like to buy a puppy.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* we would like a dog that is good around children and doesn’t bark like a husky. A medium sized dog that could run with me and wouldnt be too challenging to train and well behaved around other dogs.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* my wife is mostly interested in dogs that she considers beautiful such as the Samoyed(example for her idea of beauty in a dog). For myself I always loved Saint Bernards, a giant, calm and friendly dog. But it’s not very practical since my wife is quite small and feels intimidated by the size.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* to follow basic commands like stop, wait, leave it. And lie down and follow me while running. (Jogging around 5km)

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Not at all

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I have a few hours per day spare.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* about 2 hours per day. We will go to dog parks occasionally as well as open land.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* up to 30 mins a day and willing to pay for bi-monthly grooming.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* a medium sized dog maybe around 20 inches. The middle to high end of medium.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* less barking and slobber, a moderate amount of shedding would be ok. I don’t mind cleaning the floor every day but I don’t want to spend 5 minutes with a lint roller every time I leave the house.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* important

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* somewhere in the middle but definitely snuggly over cat like.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* eager to please

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* friendly to cautious but not aggressive or afraid.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* no since we will come across a lot of dogs every day.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* just the common things like leash pulling.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* very rarely completely alone, maybe once every 1-2 months we will go out for a day trip late morning to evening. Preferably the dog would be ok with it, but we can easily arrange a visitor or care if not.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* no preferences different to those mentioned already. My wife will occasionally feed/ walk the dog, but mostly it will be me with the ‘help’ of my son.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* turtle in an aquarium. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* yes all the time since I have a 2 year old.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* my own house.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* China, there are only bans on the really big dogs. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* peak summers usually around 35c but can reach 40c at times winter typically sits around 0c give or take a few degrees. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

Of course we did, and he ended up being the best dog I could ask for. Very calm, great with kids, house trained, never tore anything apart, which is exceptional for a husky. 

Well last night at the age of 14 we had to put him down, he’s had a host of medical issues for the past 6 months or so. What ended up being the end was a large growth that tore open. Surgery was the only option but at his age there was a high chance he wouldn’t survive and honestly I don’t think we could take care of the aftercare with a newborn baby on the way due next week. 

I miss him so much. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ctcq1y/rip_jax_husky_14/
yawn48,Fly out to see family dog before she passes?,18,2024-05-16 10:33:57+00:00,"Hey everyone. First I’d like to start off by saying I don’t really post much/at all and am not sure if this is the right sub or incorrectly tagged so I’m sorry if this is being posted in the wrong place. My mind has been all over the place these past couple days and I feel like I just need some advice.

For context, our dog Nala recently turned 9 years old. She’s a Rottweiler and my family got her the year I graduated college. I was the person who picked her up to bring her home as a puppy and I lived in my parent’s house with her for 4.5 years before moving out with my girlfriend. I couldn’t bring her with me so she stayed with my parents. They moved to another state 2 years ago and it’s roughly 2.5 hr flight away. (I promise this is all relevant)

She started having some kidney issues a few months ago and my parents did what they could to help her with that. She was a bit overweight so they changed her diet to be healthier (less kibble and more natural veggies, cooked chicken, and rice, etc) and she lost around 15 lbs. She was at a healthy weight and seemed to be doing better for a bit. 

However, this past Wednesday my mom texted my sister and I that she had to take Nala to the vet because this week she was not doing well. She was lethargic, had nausea, and was not eating normally for a few days. They notified her that she was having kidney failure and basically gave her 2 options. Either try to help her for as long as possible by using a daily IV of fluids which would be extremely expensive, or euthanasia. She was given a week’s supply of the fluid to give her so they could make a decision and have time to see what my sister and I would want to do. 

Just a day later (yesterday) my mom texts me that she hasn’t eaten or drank anything all day and is very lethargic and just lays in one of their side rooms all day. My mom said she doesn’t know if she will make it through this weekend.

And this is where I need some advice. I don’t know if I should try to fly down there to see her one last time before she passes or if I should let them proceed so she doesn’t have to suffer longer than she has to. Flying down would be a hassle and expensive on such short notice but I feel so guilty that I’m not there with Nala. 

Maybe I’m attributing too many human emotions to her but I feel like I abandoned her in a sense. I was there with her for half her life and then just basically “disappeared”. I mean I was with her since day 1 and while living home was the one who played with her the most and took care of her equally with everyone else. The last time I saw her was 1.5 years ago but she never seemed to forget me even though I saw her pretty infrequently after I had moved out. 

What tears me up is that I wonder if there is a part of her that wonders when she’s going to see me again or not. And if she does, then more than anything I feel like if there is a chance that her seeing me brings her a sense of happiness, comfort, a positive distraction from her illness, and I guess in a sense closure in her last days then I’d want to do that for her no matter the cost to me. I just can’t shake the thought of her closing her eyes for the last time and being happy my parents are with her but there being a piece of her mind thinking “But where are you?”.

The other part of me doesn’t want her to suffer longer than she has to so having her endure what she’s going through for another day or so before I can get there feels extremely selfish. Maybe I’m just projecting my feelings on her and my presence would not actually make much of a difference. I just don’t know what to do right now and would appreciate any advice or insight I can get. Thank you all in advance for any help or support you can give.

TLDR: My family dog may not make it through the weekend and I don’t know if I should fly to my parent’s on short notice to see her before she passes or let her go so she doesn’t have to suffer more than she needs to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ct9tm8/fly_out_to_see_family_dog_before_she_passes/

I do walk him twice a day for a minimum of 30 min each. But the rest of the day I feel he is bored. 
I tried to play a couple of game, fetch, puzzle games, or find the treat but he usually finishes in 20 min and then just lies down.

ivegotcheesyblasters,Possible bad breeder/rescue? What would you do?,1,2024-05-14 20:26:15+00:00,"Tater Todd the Dog came to us a year ago through a rescue that plucked him from an Alabama kill shelter at 9mo and brought him to New England, where we took him home. He has obvious angular leg deformity (eg his front legs bend inward at the ankle, not unlike a dachshund), leukotrichia (hair grows back white when damaged) and a slight overbite (his tongue frequently sticks out, yes it's adorable)

Per Embark - where he's so fancy I can find over a dozen first and second cousins - Todd is 100%, purebred Catahoula Leopard Dog. Not what I expected, as he was listed as a ""lab mix"" in his NE adoption paperwork. CLDs are rare up here, so I'm not blaming the NE rescue. He doesn't have the strong markings associated with the breed.... but if you know what to look for, it's pretty obvious. So why does the original Alabama rescue currently have a lot of Todd lookalikes up for adoption, listed as Labrador Retrievers? Not mixes: just Labs.

I've worked with dogs for 10 years. As we’re far in the north and rarely see CLDs, even I didn't clock his breed until Embark. While he's wonderful, he's not as…. simple, I guess, as Labs are expected to be. He's incredibly high energy and NOT a first time owner kind of pup. The first 2-3 months were *tough.* He needs attention, tons of exercise and near constant stimulation. Our trainers agree he's one of the smartest dogs they've ever worked with.

(Interestingly, Todd is either the most bulletproof dog ever or someone truly cared for him as a puppy. He's pretty fearless and doesn't care about storms, alarms, fireworks, or murdering small animals. He's full of love for all, especially children and other dogs. In every other respect he's an absolutely stellar dog, just not physically ideal.)

Because of this, I'm afraid the rescue is intentionally obfuscating the breeds under the guise of “we can't prove we knew and there's nothing you can do about it.” But in the wrong environment with people who don't have extensive dog experience, this could have gone VERY poorly. Plenty of people cannot offer the care a CLD needs and (rightfully, imo) filter out the breed as an option. It's a situation ripe for rehoming, with the dog more confused and upset than before and less likelihood of a positive outcome.

Back to the breeder: I've come to the hesitant conclusion there's a possibility he was intentionally bred, but dumped at a shelter when he didn't meet the breed standards - eg the breeder didn't want him associated with their business due to his deformities and is trying to hide their mistakes while continuing to breed from the same stock/lines. How else would a purebred dog with an amazing personality end up in a shelter at 9 months?

So I did a little digging on the ol' internet. There is an active breeder in AL a few towns over from where his original rabies tag was issued, and one of the current mothers bears a pretty striking resemblance... which stands out, as Todd doesn't have average Catahoula markings. Not a silver bullet, but interesting nonetheless. There aren't a lot of CLD breeders out there.

Now for the point (sorry for the rant!): **Is there any action you would take with this information?** Should I contact the rescue or breeder? Should I reach out on Embark to his first cousins (some still in AL) to get their stories?

I'll be honest, I’m not sure what resolution I'm looking for or likely to achieve. Can I shut down a bad breeder from across the country? Am I losing my mind?? Maybe they're a ""decent"" breeder who gave or sold Todd to some asshole who was disappointed in how he developed, and rather than go back to the breeder simply dumped him. (I would be very surprised if this was the case; purebreds are fucking expensive and ""decent"" breeders will take a dog back.)

Additionally, does the rescue know about this somehow? CLDs are common in the South, I can't believe they wouldn't clock one with obvious features. It's pretty shitty to withhold important breed info that could properly inform a prospective adopter. Are they more interested in turnover than a permanent placement? Is there anything to be gained from calling them out? What would you do??

I would love some perspective or advice, this is driving me crazy. Thanks for reading :) Now go pet a dog!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cs28gu/possible_bad_breederrescue_what_would_you_do/

Our neighbor asked for 1 of the puppies when they’re ready, which we agreed to.

I have two awesome border collies. They get along well and love chasing and play herding each other in the backyard. We always monitor this play to make sure it doesn’t veer into aggression. They both take turns chasing and tacking each other in the way that only two herding dogs would find enjoyable. 

The only problem is that after a play session like this, they both tend to get slobbery. Even though they aren’t biting each other, they are herding dogs so they are pretty mouthy with each other when they play. 

I can’t stand the spitty smell when they come in from one of these play sessions. 

We bathe them as often as we can without risking drying out their skin. But alas- the stink remains.

bg0129,My dog obsesses over things to the point where she won’t do her business—is this normal??,5,2024-05-15 12:45:35+00:00,"I have a mixed-breed dog (half cocker spaniel mixed with lab, husky, and pit) and I don’t know if this is normal dog behavior but sometimes she gets waaay too obsessive about things to the point where she won’t do the things she needs to do. For example, right now with all the cicadas emerging, everytime I take her outside she just walks around eating them. She doesn’t like being outside alone so I have to stand out there with her and I think that’s where my annoyance comes from, because she WON’T POOP!!! She just obsessively hunts for cicadas while I attempt to distract her attention away from them enough for her to do what she needs to do. Which is VERY DIFFICULT.

Same thing happens every fall. We have a huge wood pile out by our storage shed and sometimes critters like to hide in there, so every time she goes outside around that time she beelines straight for the wood pile and just starts nosing and prodding around and will be out there for HOURS if I let her.

Normally I wouldn’t care except that like I said, she completely ignores the fact that she needs to poop or pee, and it’s concerning me!! She’s completely housetrained so she knows not to do her business in the house, but what am I supposed to do if she won’t do it outside either because she’s too preoccupied with other activities? I can’t leave her out there because the moment I’m back in the house she’s begging to be let back in, and I can’t spend all day just standing out there with her. She doesn’t even like playing with me when she’s more interested in the cicadas and the wood critters. I just don’t know how to direct her attention away from them! I don’t want to punish her for it because she’s not really doing anything WRONG, she’s just being a dog lol.

princesspaesch,Breaking Coprophagia,3,2024-05-15 00:55:14+00:00,"Hi. I'm seeking any possible help (or please, some encouragement) with our new rescue having very bad coprophagia. Im unsure of her conditions prior to living with us as she was found on the street, extremely malnourished. I imagine coprophagia is a habit of hers that has developed from her past life as it's been an issue for the two months we've had her. We have two other dogs and have been actively trying to change our lifestyle to accommodate this new dog's habit and I'll be honest - it's been extremely challenging and I'm not hopeful of any permanent solutions.

I really thought proactivity would be the solution and for the most part it is, but it seems like within seconds of me taking my eyes off the dogs or if they sprint across the yard half an acre away, she gets to the poop before I'm able to pick it up. She has stalked our other dogs so badly so that she can eat poop that the other dogs will try to go to remote areas of the yard like in shrubs or under trees at the fence line. This makes it even more challenging to pick up after them. She's also developed a fear of my panicked reactions trying to get her away from poop so she is especially sneaky and quick with trying get at them.


We've tried pumpkin, greek yogurt, letting the dogs out at separate times, proactivity with picking up poop, talking with our vet. What are other suggestions? Am I doomed to having to walk this dog on a lead in our large fenced in backyard for the rest of her life? I feel so hopeless. Our other dogs free roam with no issues so this is all so new to me. If anyone has had success with dealing with coprophagia please let me know, I'd love to know your experience. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cs8ahw/breaking_coprophagia/
chaoticlilbirb,How do I give my dog his best life?,1,2024-05-15 02:13:04+00:00,"So, I need advice on how to give my dog his best life.

Wade is the name of our 5yr old aussie. We co-own him with his breeder. He was given to us about a year ago as he retired from showing, and is now simply a breeding dog. I don't love his breeder in our lives, but it is what it is.

My fiance and live in an apartment. We are both full-time college students, so living in a place with a yard was pretty much out of the question. That being said, we picked this complex because of the many sidewalks and pathways - as well as the dog-park where he can go off-leash and socialize. 

We feed him Purina active with water or sometimes unsalted chicken broth, and give him treats/dog safe veggies/coconut oil/peanut-butter(no xylitol!!). 

We wash him with sensitive skin shampoo and conditioner, I groom him at home with shears and trimmers about once a month or every two weeks, trim his nails when needed, give him ""toothbrushes"" (dental chews) every couple of days, and walk him at least twice a day for 1.5 miles each.

He has extreme anxiety and an incredibly enlarged prostate (from being intact, although there are other problems). Both of which he is on medication for as prescribed by his vet. Both of which cause him difficulties daily.

I try and keep his brain active since we're in an apt. We do food puzzles, training, and stimulating activities like ice block treats or letting him figure out how to break down a paper towel roll...

We try our best, but we have a lot to improve on. Sorry for the novel! Any advice on how to do better without breaking the bank or losing all free time??",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cs9ven/how_do_i_give_my_dog_his_best_life/

6Foot2AndHandsome,Should I leave my pup with biological parents?,2,2024-05-15 07:25:26+00:00,"TLDR: Where is best to leave my puppy for a month? At time of departure:
Aged 19 weeks
Looked after 11 weeks 
Breed - Rottweiler, German Shepherd, Golden Retriever

Hey guys I have a pup which I’ve had from 8 weeks old, and I am planning a long vacation back home as it’s been a while since I’ve seen my family.

So I am from Europe, living in USA, I have planned a trip August - September to go back home but something unexpected happened recently.

My friend’s adorable dog had puppies. Me and my girlfriend have really been thinking about this for a while and it was perfect opportunity, a companion from a good family so we could pass up and offered our home. 

He’s been with us a week or so, really fitting in, just have this trip coming up and it really is bothering me as I’m concerned what should I do about this situation, we have been putting our best effort to show good habits and train him and essentially we will have to leave for a month at a peak bonding time it feels.

To get some numbers, the puppy will be 19 weeks old at the date of our departure, which we would have spent 11 of those weeks together. We will come back by his week 23, so we will miss 4 weeks from 19-23 weeks of age.

Our options: 
My friend who has the biological dad would be happy to look after him, and I trust him as he raised his own dog very well

Leave with my girlfriends mum and dad where we all live currently, I’m a little sketched out personally as the mum sometimes gets shouty and freaks out at the tv meanwhile the dad is super chill, just works a lot

Hybrid of the above options, kinda self explanatory, just don’t want to give mixed signals to our boy

Hire a daycare for a month? Not sure I never considered but if that would be best, as it’s kinda of ‘neutral’ in terms of psychology perhaps?

Sorry guys I don’t know everything or enough, but I just want to do what’s best for our new family member, all and any feedback is appreciated, with reasoning if possible. Would like to learn as much as I can. 

Thank you Reddit!

this_is_me24,My fiance dog is making our life harder by the day ,7,2024-05-15 08:39:27+00:00,"My fiance (31m) and me (32f) have 2 dogs, we both came to the relationship with their own one.
His dog is 8 yo, German shepherd female that was rescued from the wild when she was about 2 years old.

My fiance is the sweetest, most kind and gentle man I have ever met, and the fact he took her in despite severe behavioral issues is noble.

But now, even after countless trainings with professionals, hours and hours of working with her at home, patience and fitting his and now our life to be good for her, its getting out of hand for me.

We are planning on starting a family soon, and she is so very difficult. She barks all the time and won't be quiet no matter what we do, she is hostile to every new person so we cannot have friends and family over. During walks she's pulling as hard as she can, no matter the leash kind, and will try to attack all dogs, cats and male humans she sees. 

We cannot trust her with anyone, she is constantly scared being outside and is startled by every single noise. 

It's becoming so hard for me to enjoy my doggy life (our other dog is perfect, 11 years old and and have him since he was a pup)

I feel bad I can't love her like I love our second dog, I feel bad I am running out or patience with her and I can't find too many good things about living with her as a family with a baby. 

She went through so much in her life before she came here, and we won't abandon her obviously, but I'm really upset about spending the next numerous years with her like this.. 

My fiance feels the same, but is a bit more sentimental than me towards her so he has more patience. 

Any suggestions? And sorry for the long rant

The only problem is, the dog would likely be allowed inside the house as well as the backyard. Most people who let their dogs inside seem to have a dog door so the dog can go out whenever he/she needs or wants to. However, I have two cats that are indoors-only (they only go outside on a harness/leash and I will be building them a catio). With the cats being indoors-only, I don't want to install a dog door as that would give the cats an opportunity to get out.

I've seen some people train their dogs to ring a doorbell when they want to or need to go out. Thoughts on that? Any other way to allow dogs access to both the house and yard without having a dog door or other opening?

Is the solution to just assume? Open the door throughout the day and see if the dog wants or needs to go out? I have no issue with being vigilant and opening the door manually if my dog shows signs of wanting to go out.

AstronautSecret7024,Why Is My Dog Peeing Inside?,6,2024-05-15 18:00:10+00:00,"Hello! 

I just adopted a two and a half year old dog which I believe is a basset hound lab mix. He was a stray and lived on the streets before I got him. He’s very sweet but needs a lot of basic training and I’ve started to run into a problem with him peeing inside.

When I got him home he had two accidents in my room which is where I was keeping him for the time being to help the transition of a new place be less stressful and to allow him and the cat to have space and meet slowly.

I was told he wasn’t fully potty trained and expected him to need training, but after the first couple hours he didn't have any accidents in my room and hasn't since for a week. However, when I started to let him have more freedom of the house, he has started to pee on things but not in my room and only the rest of the house. I am confused as to why as he has been able to hold his pee through the night and while I was at work and now every couple hours he pees.

I also have a hard time catching him in the act to stop him so I was wondering if there is anything I can do to stop him and train him to only go outside. I do have to work most days so I can’t watch him all the time but even when I’m at home trying to keep an eye on him, he still finds a way to pee inside without me looking.

 I am still trying to crate train him but he still is not comfortable with being in the crate with the door closed. He also has mild separation anxiety which I am trying to work on.

I am going to try and take him to get trained soon, but I am trying to figure out how to train him on my own for the time being while I am figuring that out.

When we do this she pants a lot less, searches for cold shady spots in the house less, is less prone to hotspots, and is more playful.

But if it's daytime and we leave the house, he starts barking and crying after 10 seconds.

During the day we have to leave him alone for 1-2 hours. Will he eventually get used to ""daytime alone time"" or should we start increasing the time from 10 seconds to several hours?

yebat_kopat,Recommend a Cuddle Buddy,8,2024-05-15 08:28:06+00:00,"**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

I have always been around dogs including growing up with dogs and taking an active role in training and care. Family dogs have included two mutt rescues, two Goldens, and currently two Havanese (which I take care of when they can't travel with my parents).

**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**

I'm open to rescue but would likely need a puppy (as I need to be able to train and socialize early on to get what I'm after)

**3) Describe your ideal dog.**

A clingy couch potato that doesn't regularly need a lot of stimulation outside of hanging out with me.

**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

It never would have been on my quick list, but looking at my needs no breed comes up more than a Bullmastiff. My concerns are the drool (I'm OCD), and with the size with regard to lifespan, food costs, and physical control- I have a bad back, but that's going to be an issue with any size poorly trained dog and most activity will likely be off leash.

I loved our Goldens and either one would fit nicely into my needs (save the long hair). But I'm worried we got lucky with low energy Goldens (they often didn't get daily activity and yet no behavior or health issues)- so because of energy levels they aren't on my list right now.

I like many of the pitbull breeds, they are a great size, I like the idea of combating the image of the big scary pitbull- but like Goldens they aren't on my list because of worries of energy levels.

I'm not inherently opposed to labs.

I always adored Corgis but I don't think they are a match to my needs (barking, energy levels, small).

I don't want to overly worry about energy levels, obviously most dogs out there don't get the ideal activity levels and they do fine. But it also feels risky going with breeds known to be higher energy.

**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

Basics- sit/stay/come/heel/bang

**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**

No

**Care Commitments**

**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

I cannot commit to daily walks or fetch, but I'm  home all day (and not WFH) so I will be attentive to pooch's needs and he will always get a lot of attention if not activity. I'm prepared for the fact that no two dogs are alike, and things like activity/engagement levels will adjust over time based on my dogs individual needs and his behavior.

Ideally he would spend all day with me, including multiple visits a week to my parents- where he can take advantage of a fenced yard and socialize with their two Havanese (which he would begin right away).

**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

Not a believer in dog parks. I think I mostly answered this question in the previous.

**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

Similar to exercise I will respond to his needs. I'm not commiting up front to weekly baths and daily tooth brushing, but if his behavior or the vet indicates an area to focus I will do so. On a regular basis I mostly anticipate brushing weeklyish, nails regularly, ears/teeth etc. as needed. It will be more difficult, but the same stuff I keep up with already on my cat.

**Personal Preferences**

**10) What size dog are you looking for?**

It doesn't really matter though I'm not usually into smaller dogs.

**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

Barking must be minimal due to apartment living. Shedding and slobber are what they are, like anyone I would prefer zero, some is ok, with the right dog I will learn to love his slobber right? Lol

**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

Fairly but I'm a believer that virtually any dog is capable of this with decent training.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

I already have a cat, he gives me plenty of personal space to fill with a pooch!

**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

Eager to please

**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

A bark is fine, but it needs to stop quickly both by command or naturally. Window placement means he wouldn't actually have much visibility to the front yard and cannot see people at the door.

**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

No, but he will be socialized with other dogs on a regular basis right out of the gate. This is an example of where I would be apprehensive about rescuing.

**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

Not that come to mind

**Lifestyle**

**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

Just for quick errands or appointments, an hour or two here or there.

**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

No one else in the home.

**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**

One cat, he has some exposure to adjustments including dogs, and I'm prepared for a slow introduction process. I'm able to block off an entire room for him with his box and he has lots of vertical options (Jackson Galaxy wouldn't be disappointed).

**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

No

**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

No

**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

None that I'm aware of but my vet (family friend) will let me know when I talk breeds with him.

**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

Fairly temperate with the odd spike in heat or cold, nothing unusual.

**Additional Information and Questions**

**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

I'm disabled and there is a potential for a service dog. I don't think this route is worth pursuing though as the main physical service that I would benefit from is with waking (one goal with a dog is bringing some schedule and routine to my days), which any dog is inherently going to do. Otherwise the dog would mostly be serving emotional support needs (eg: providing pressure and comfort during panic attacks will be appreciated, but no need for a dog that can like alert to oncoming attacks). With that limited scope it doesn't seem like it would be worth the time and money to pursue, especially with people in much greater need out there. But, I guess I'm curious if anyone thinks that's worth pursuing.

**26) Feel free to ask any questions below.**

Animelizards,apartment breeds to help get more active,3,2024-05-15 03:12:49+00:00,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

- family has had several dogs but -my- dog from age 8-25 was a chihuahua, sadly not trained very well as i was a child. currently learning how to handle dogs better at my job

2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

- either is fine but i would prefer an adult dog (so rescue or retired breeder)

3. Describe your ideal dog.

- friendly and playful without being too off the wall in energy, able to be taken around new places as i moved to a very dog friendly area where everyone has theirs with them. something to encourage me and my roommates to go outside more/go on smaller trail walks. we are all gamers in our 30s so nothing we need to run marathons with. a bonus is if it has workable fur/hair as i am a bather at a grooming salon and it would be fun to learn to groom my own dog

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

- shih tzu, toy/mini poodle, boston terrier, pug mixes, pomeranian. preferably toy/small dogs but medium ones aren't out of the question 

5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

- simple and nessacery commands like sit/stay/going to a crate if needed

6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

- does grooming competitions count? if not with me then my coworkers could use them as a model

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

- on a work day i have around 5 hours of free time between coming home and going to bed

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

- daily walks and play, longer walks during off days/if i happen to have taken them to work

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

- daily, though i am starting to shy away from double/tripple coated dogs like a pom/spitz as the brushing can be a bit too intense sometimes

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

- toy to medium

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

- moderate amount. the only breed ive seen that sheds an intolerable amount is westies

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

- as i live in an apartment i would not do this. in my own yard maybe if the dog has good recall (my chihuahua had great recall/didnt walk far from me so she was not leashed at home)

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

- a good median or leaning towards independent. i sleep in a loft bed so a dog that is so clingy it needs to sleep with me would be a sad situation

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

- leaning toward eager to please. i'd prefer a dog that is more dog than cat

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

- i would like a much friendlier-to-strangers dog than the ones ive had in the past. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

- i would seek training if that were the case but as i would like to have my dog in public/at work around other dogs id like a more dog-friendly breed

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

- dogs that are very escapey/good at climbing though i think this is more a sporting/bird dog trait

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

- one roommate is unemployeed/disabled so it would not be left alone but i also would not want a dog that is incapable of being alone if need be

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

- no standard poodles, though i believe that to be too big/unmanagable of a dog for me currently. roommates can help with basic needs though as we are on the 2nd floor the primary person to take the dog outside would be me, so training to use a puppy pad or being able to be put on a feeding schedule to manage potty breaks would be a must

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

- we have a chinchilla, a cat, and two lizards, so a breed with little to no prey drive would be prefered.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

- no

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

- weight limit of 50lbs/typical ""banned"" breeds

- washington state, us

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

- mild climate of 30-50 in the winter and 50-80 in the summer

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

- i know skin issues are more genetic than breed specific but as both my chihuahua and last cat had skin problems i'd prefer a breed that is not known to be prone to them

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

- does anyone have any advice for applying to private rescue groups? i feel as though as soon as i put that i live in an apartment on my applications they throw it in the trash. every local rescue requires a fenced in yard/home ownership for even the smallest/laziest dog breeds. they also request very extensive medical records of previous pets but having just moved here from the south i'm sure my previous vets have more urgent things to do than dig through nearly decades old files for these groups and are leaving their emails on read.

 small dogs metaphorically fly off the shelves at the humane society so my other option would be breeders but i'd rather rescue an adult dog in need of a home than spend 3 grand on a new puppy. i know that texas sends their dogs all over the country but these out-of-town dogs arent afforded meet and greets so it seems like a mild gamble of taking their word for how the dog looks/behaves before adopting them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1csb0tm/apartment_breeds_to_help_get_more_active/

    1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
    
    * This will be my first dog, though I had a cat for 8 years previously.
    
    2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?
    
    * No preference
    
    3)Describe your ideal dog.
    
    * I would like one who can accompany me on walks daily (including potentially long hikes on weekends or dog parks) but also would be willing to chill with me on the couch happily at any time. I would prefer one without serious separation anxiety as I do leave the house daily for several hours at a time, even though I work from home. Also, tolerance/friendliness towards other dogs/people would be nice as I do enjoy going to breweries and would love a companion along with me.
    
    4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
    
    * I'm just beginning my research, but have been intrigued by Standard Schnauzers, Boston Terriers, and the Spanish/Portuguese water dogs.
    
    5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
    
    * Basic things for now, potentially more advanced stuff down the road.
    
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
    
    * Definitely not.
    
    **Care Commitments**
    
      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
    
    * I can easily do several hours due to the amount of downtime I have with working from home. 
    
    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
    
    * Same answer as above, several hours if needed. I have a dog park at my apartment and several parks around that I could take them. Anything from walking to playing fetch to running.
    
    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
    
    * I suppose weekly? I am willing to pay a professional for anything besides brushing.
    
    **Personal Preferences**
    
    10)What size dog are you looking for?
    
    * Apartment will not allow over 75 pounds, so less than that. I don't have any interest in a 5 pound dog though.
    
    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
    
    * Not much of any. Barking should be minimal in an apartment.
    
    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
    
    * Not particularly important, more of an added bonus if able.
    
    **Dog Personality and Behavior**
    
    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
    
    * Both?
    
    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
    
    * No preference
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
    
    * Certainly no barking if someone knocks. Attentiveness or walking to the door would be perfectly fine by me. 
    
    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
    
    * Absolutely not.
    
    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
    
    * I wouldn't ever tolerate any kind of aggression, but otherwise I can't think of any.

    25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.
    
    * I live on the third floor of an apartment so I'd prefer any dog that will not suffer from hip problems or that would be difficult to carry upstairs if necessary (I COULD carry 50 pounds upstairs though wouldn't want to often).

stileshasbadjuju,Dog Breed Recommendation for Autistic Adult?,59,2024-05-14 19:30:34+00:00,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This would be the first dog that I own entirely myself. I previously owned a Labrador with help from my family and loved him, but would not be able to look after/walk a dog of that size on my own due to poor physical health. I really enjoyed training my Labrador and would look forward to training a new dog.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

* I am open to both.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* I would like a small-medium dog who can act as an emotional support companion for me. They cannot be super high energy or very strong as my fitness level/health is not very good, however I am more than willing to commit to at least a walk (1-2 hours) and playtime every day. I would need a cuddly dog that is easy to train, obedient and calm. Due to a member of the household being allergic to dogs, less shedding is preferred but not essential. 

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I am thinking that some form of spaniel would be good for me. I love Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and they may be a good match, but I am concerned by the health issues they can possess. I also think Cocker Spaniels are a possible good match. I really like Corgis but I think they may be too high energy?

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* I really enjoy training my dog, so I would like to teach them basic obedience and then further tricks if they enjoy training. 

1. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I would love to hang out with my dog most of the time. I work short shifts 2-3 days a week and would be home otherwise.

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* I would be able to bring my dog for walks of at least an hour's duration every day, plus playtime. These would be slow leisurely walks as my physical fitness is not very good. 

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am open to learning how to groom my dog as best as I can. If not I am willing to pay a professional.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* I would like a small or medium sized dog. They would sleep with me in my room.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Not much barking as I live in a shared household. Shedding would preferably not be too much but can be dealt with. Slobber preferably not much but is not a deal breaker.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important, while it would be nice to be able to have the dog off-leash I will likely keep them on a lead when out and about.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Very snuggly!

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* I want a dog that is friendly to strangers and visitors.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, I would like my dog to be friendly to other dogs.

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I would need my dog to be friendly, calm and responsive to commands 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I will be home most of the time. I work infrequently and people will most often be home when I am not there.

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* The others in the household would also like a calm and quiet, friendly dog. One enjoys walks and will be able to walk the dog or take them places if I am unavailable. One member of the household is allergic to dogs but does not mind some shedding. 

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* No

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Ireland, no

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Irish weather is all over the place, haha. Tends to be rainy or cold but can sometimes be sunny.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Due to being autistic I would like a dog that will not be too difficult for me.

Hi there,

I’m posting out of desperation to see if anyone has had any experience with fainting in dogs. I have a female Shih Tzu who is 14 years old. She has mitral valve disease and a heart murmur which is controlled. Apart from these conditions, she is very active and healthy. A couple of years ago, she started to have fainting episodes. At first, they happened when she was barking or excited from seeing other dogs. She starts losing her balance, falls, her neck and limbs extend, and she vocalizes (screams). This usually lasts for under a minute and she gets back up slowly. Once she’s up and settled, it’s almost like nothing happened, she’s completely back to normal. Sometimes when she faints, she will pee or poop (only if she hasn’t gone recently). 
The frequency of her fainting episodes seemed to lessen after starting her on Vetmedin for her mitral valve disease. The cardiologist said that her mitral valve disease was not severe enough to explain her fainting episodes. Over the last couple of years, we’ve seen 3 different cardiologists and 1 neurologist who have pretty much concluded that she is experiencing vasovagal syncope. 
Recently, she has been fainting multiple times a day, without being excited, whereas previously it did not happen more than once a day. It usually happens when she gets up after lying down or sleeping for a while, when she gets in the car, or after she pees. She was prescribed Theophylline recently, which is supposed to help with vasovagal syncope, but she still seems to be fainting just as often. I’m really not sure what to do as it seems I’ve exhausted all of my options. She is otherwise healthy, but the episodes have been really stressful, and I’m sure confusing for her. I’ve been carrying her practically everywhere, which seems to help sometimes. I have also been wondering if there is a link between not eating/being fasted and her episodes. If anyone has any experience or input at all, it would really be appreciated. Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1crzip5/faintingsyncopal_episodes/
aptiu4,New Rescue Yorkie won't leave corner/crate,0,2024-05-14 17:15:16+00:00,"Hi all!
Around one month ago, I rescued a 3 year old Yorkie named Marty. He had previously been used for breeding in an Amish puppy mill, and the rescue said he did not see outside his kennel much for his first 3 years. It has been around a month now, and he is still incredibly skittish and fearful. Not aggressive, he will not bite or growl. However, I have not gotten him to voluntarily come out of his crate in the living room or the corner of any room (when crate is not in the room). 

I am understanding of the fact that it takes time for a new rescue dog to adjust to the home, I have had dogs in the past that have been fearful and avoidant as well in the begining stages. But Marty does not appear to be very driven by treats/food or toys, making it a little hard to find something to connect to him with.

The woman at the rescue said ""You can't coddle to his fears, you have to take a strong lead and introduce him to new stimuli whether he likes it or not"". I have been trying to do that in gradual moderation, but it seems to make him more avoidant and distant from me, not less. 

I understand time will be the biggest helper in this situation, but is there any advice or insight someone in a similar situation would have? I just want to balance taking a strong lead and giving him time and space to adjust. Thank You!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1crxiwe/new_rescue_yorkie_wont_leave_cornercrate/

We don't necessarily need live tracking, it's more to find him should the MIL get lost 😂 So I'm thinking of getting an AirTag, but the idea of a GPS/SIM card seems inviting - although the forest has very little signal, so I worry we'd pay for a mobile subscription but not need it.

PhoebeH98,How can I help my dogs separation anxiety and get him to stop barking when left on his own?,20,2024-05-14 14:58:50+00:00,"Just shy of 3 weeks ago, I lost my 16 year old golden retriever, who has been the most wonderful dog I could’ve ever asked for. This leaves my 10 yo shih tzu- who has never known a day without him- on his own. Since the passing of my golden boy, the little guy has understandably become much more clingy towards myself, to the point he has to follow me everywhere I go in the house. 

After it happened, I was given a couple of days off work before returning, and for two shifts he was in the house on his own for 3 hours in between me leaving for work and a roommate returning from work, and he did not handle it well. He was crying, whining, barking, shaking and very visibly distressed when they came home, and was very frantic when I came home later that night, far more so than before. I had a couple of shifts after that where someone was home with him the whole time, and while still very mopey during the day and hyper and frantic for me when I came in, he was less distressed. 

After this I had a pre-planned week of annual leave, during which I’ve looked in to my options. I live in a fairly small, fairly rural town and there aren’t any kinds of doggy daycare type services. There are dog walking services, but that doesn’t solve my issue. I don’t have any family or friends I could reliably leave him with whenever I work. So, I’ve asked my work if I can try bringing him in with me, which they’ve agreed to. My workplace has an office and staff area on the top floor, and retail/business area downstairs. The idea was I would keep him upstairs and regularly (every hour maybe 2 max) check on him and sometimes be in the office with him for prolonged periods doing work in there. I figured stretches of an hour or two alone would be better than 7-9 hours alone. 

I’ve returned to work and we’ve given it a few tries, and it is not going well. He lasts about 10-15 minutes before the crying and whining starts, which will eventually turn to barking. Each day I’ve taken him on a massive walk right beforehand in hopes it tires him out, arrived early to get him calm and settled with me before going downstairs, brought him toys and chews, which will keep him occupied for a few minutes before he gets bored of them and the crying starts. 

So, does anybody have any advice on how to help his separation anxiety and/or specifically train him out of the barking/noisiness? I really want this to work out for him, I can’t stand him being so distressed and I don’t know how best to help him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cru8a6/how_can_i_help_my_dogs_separation_anxiety_and_get/

We live is Missouri where it’s pretty much wet all spring. This morning she pooped inside because we could not get her to go all day yesterday. 

Any tips for dogs that hate a wet ground? We considered the little booties but I can’t imagine she would tolerate them lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1crs9n5/how_to_deal_with_dog_that_wont_use_bathroom_when/
lawlez1,New shelter dog ,1,2024-05-14 13:24:07+00:00,"I’m an experienced pet owner whose old companion passed away in February. I adopted a dog whom I had an instant connection with. I was told by the shelter that she’d be calm enough for me to handle (I get daily migraines of varying degrees) however…she’s definitely a handful. She’s a little over a year, has absolutely no training (doesn’t know “no” or anything) and is destructive outside despite having toys to play with. Yesterday, she started digging a hole where my cable line is…I live in a small townhouse with a small fenced in backyard so I leave the door open for her and lay on the couch. 

I’ve only had her a few days but I’m exhausted, crying every day, and just overwhelmed. I kind of regret adopting her because I was used to the quiet I had before even if it was hard to deal with some times. It doesn’t help that she looks VERY similar to my old dog (completely unintentional) so when she lays a certain way, I just start crying cause I miss my old dog. 

I love her but I dread getting up in the morning because I know it’s gonna be hectic and frustrating. I never would’ve thought that I would regret this decision or have thoughts of taking her back…but I’m drowning. Today I woke up with my head killing me and I just dread dealing with anything. I’ve been told that there’s no shame in admitting that this just isn’t a good fit…but I just feel so damn bad and I’m hard on myself for thinking it. Taking her back would destroy me because I’d think of her in that setting again and it just makes me want to cry. I’m also afraid that if I took her back, I’d regret doing it a week or so later. 

I’m at my wits end and my mental health is suffering because of everything. I just don’t know what to do. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1crs244/new_shelter_dog/
ActuallyHovatine,Please Help. I don’t know what to do.,1,2024-05-14 13:21:36+00:00,"My wife and I have two small dogs. Both are chihuahua mixes and they get along well. 

One of our dogs has recently had a major shift in personality and has become very aggressive at times, completely unprovoked. He has become insanely protective over my wife and clings to her nonstop, but will also bite her if she happens to move her feet in a certain way while sleeping etc. (She is not pregnant)
He also gets aggressive if you try to pick him up most times or if she tries to get some time away from him. 

He has always been a nervous dog and we have managed it well, but these last few weeks have been a huge deviation from the norm. I’ve now experienced two vicious bites from him on my right arm while removing him from my wife’s vicinity after he bit her feet in the bed. 

I took him to the vet and they checked him out and said he didn’t seem to be in pain and they thought it was just anxiety so they gave us some Trazadone, which seemed to help at first but now I’m not so sure.

He’s 4 years old and intact so our next move was going to be neutering but appointments are booked for the next several weeks. 

I’m just throwing out a desperate plea for ANY sort of guidance on this. I’m sorry if the post is vague, I’m very emotional right now and it’s hard to get all the thoughts together. We love him so much and he’s as much family to us as anyone. My wife is basically ready to throw in the towel with him but I don’t know if I can even do that.

Does anybody have an insight on wait times. I'm curious if there's likely a backlog of applications or perhaps a dog suitable to my lifestyle rarely ends up being surrendered. I'm staying hopeful though the question is burning!!

No previous experience with a dog. Large secure garden 6ft fence. Active. WFH 90% of the time and visit the office once per two weeks, with a dog walker already lined up. No specific breed/size/age preference, though not particularly inclined towards bull breeds. Enjoy big hikes and camping. Appreciate this is fairly restrictive due to lack of prior experience.

She's very affectionate and friendly towards people. She walks well on a leash, is house broken, knows all of the basic dog commands, sit, lay, stay, and come. However, she has two problems. She growled at a dog in PetCo. I sternly said ""No. Stop that."" Which she did and laid down. The other problem is that I have three cats who are very much not happy with this situation. One came out for affection. When she saw him she barked and lunged towards my cat. I yelled at her and she immediately left him alone and laid down in the corner. This happened a second time. 

Should I be worried? Is it possible to train her out of this behavior so she can socialize with other animals? I don't think who ever had her before socialized her properly. I am still looking for her family and posting flyers. The shelter said she was not microchiped and my street is a common place people dump pets.

Soft_Regular_2515,Family Dog Recommendation,11,2024-05-14 08:22:54+00:00,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

It will be our first dog as an adult, growing up I had a small cattle dog cross.

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

We are open to rescue but would most likely end up going with a reputable breeder to get the specific breed that we're after.

3) Describe your ideal dog.

This may not exist but it feels like we're after the goldilocks zone of dogs. We'd like to have a small affectionate dog for our family and daughter (10) to have as a companion. Although we want it to be affectionate, we don't want it to have separation anxiety or be comfortable chilling out around the house without being held. We want it to be on the lower energy side, we're happy to take it for a walk almost every day, but if we miss one it won't go stir crazy. We'd prefer something on the quieter side. We don't mind the occasional bark at the door, but endless barking would get irritating. We want it to be okay around other dogs, even though we don't have any ourselves. Leaning towards the smaller / medium sizes.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Two leading contenders were cavalier king charles and a beagle. Both suit the profile of small to medium size, affectionate and good family dogs. Having some second thoughts about the beagle due to noise concerns. Cavalier king charles sounds good, however we're concerned it might be a little \_too\_ needy.

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic commands / manners. Not jumping on people, sit, stay, come, quiet, drop.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No, it will purely be for family company.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Our daughter will devote a significant period of time cuddling / playing. We will dedicate short training periods (10-20 minutes) combined with an evening walk.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

We'd be doing an evening walk of around 4-5 km, and have the option of using a dog park if we feel it's a good environment for the dog (i.e. handles interactions well with other dogs)

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We'd be happy to do basic grooming at home, and pay for a professional when required.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Small to medium.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding - We prefer lower (who doesn't) but it's not a deal breaker. Perhaps not to the extremes (i.e. a husky). Barking - Prefer very little. Slobber - okay with a little.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

We'd like to have the confidence of being able to let our dog off-leash and have them return on command, but we don't have any \_necessity\_ for it.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snugly dog that doesn't get distressed on it's own for a while. Both parents work from home so they will almost always ""be around"", but not necessarily in contact / actively playing at all times.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please would be nice.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

We'd prefer them just to greet strangers / be excited. A small about of barking is fine as long as they quiet down after a while.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No, we'd prefer not to have aggression towards other dogs.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Outside of the typical they must be good with kids, etc.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

The dog will rarely be left alone. Two work from home parents. We're not adverse to taking the dog out with us if it's to an appropriate location.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

Similar to what has been described here. The parents will be responsible for exercise / taking them out of an evening, the daughter will be responsible for cuddles.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

No other pets.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Our 10 year old daughter, occasionally some nephews or nieces that are slightly younger.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We own our own home.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Australia, no bans on anything relevant to what we're looking for.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Average temp is \~22c in Summer and \~14c in Winter. It can get up to extremes of 40c in Australia, but rarely and the dog would be inside.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

It's hard to convey in answers here, but a lot of these things are ""feelings"" rather than set in stone. I know every breed will have a range of behavior. No dog is guaranteed to tick all the boxes, but that's okay we're just looking to capture the majority of what we're after.

Me and my boyfriend are getting a 1.5 month old puppy (a mix between a pinscher and a small poodle, so he's a small dog because we live in a really little apartment) We are getting him way early than we thought as the lady that is taking care of him is having a really hard time with all the puppies in her hands. 

We have the intention of training the puppy by ourselves and also teach him how to travel with us.

My partner agreed to manage almost all the economic aspects because I'm currently unemployed, so I would appreciate to get not only advice on essential things for a first time dog owner, but also the things I can help with that don't involve money but are very important to take care of as well.

Any recommendation is very welcome and appreciated. 

Edit: Okay, so I'll talk to the caregiver so we can leave the puppy with his mom for a couple of weeks or even more and will keep helping the lady as much as I can so she has a lighter time with the dogs.

I still need some advice on the things I can do to help that don't have to do with the economic part so I would value some. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1crhocz/new_dog_owner/

Since he's not crate trained, I've made the kitchen on our first floor his hangout spot. I can leave him there by himself for hours while I work upstairs. I keep an eye on him through a camera all day. His routine usually involves a morning walk for his bathroom break, some fetch in the afternoon to tire him out, another walk in the evening, and sometimes I let him loose in the backyard for a bit.

Now, I'm thinking of getting him a buddy so he's got someone to hang out and play with. I've been eyeing black Cane Corsos because I love their look, but I'm worried they might be too big for us.

It's an amazing way to get his brain and body working...I use a fairly large and heavy blanket, and he really needs to get his hind legs working to solve - he's about 15lbs. And I can play this with him several times in a row. I sit next to him and encourage him, so it's great for bonding as well.

Was hoping to get more ideas of indoor hide and seek games that are similarly challenging. The snuffle mats are cool but it tends to be more of a nose game, and can be high calorie, especially for a small doggo :)

ThatGuyis123,Dog Breed Recommendations [Breeds],0,2024-05-12 21:25:21+00:00,"
 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This will be my first dog, but my father (lives with me) has had dogs before. He had 8 dogs.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I’d prefer going through a reputable breeder, but I’m open to other suggestions as well.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* I’ve been looking a lot at doodles and I mainly prefer how most of them are hypoallergenic and shed very little. I’d like a dog around mini size preferably about 25 pounds. I really like the looks of both Bernedoodles and Aussiedoodles, but I’d prefer something rarer that will catch people’s eyes. I love the tri-color on Bernedoodles and dogs with Blue-Merle coats as well. I’d like a dog that is energetic, but not too energetic. There are 2 kids (tweens) and we will have time to walk the dog for around 30 minutes and we will also play fetch with it in the backyard. I’d like for it to be moderately protective, like if someone tried to intrude my house, then it should try to stop the intruder, but it should also be friendly. I’d love to play with it and I’d also love to just snuggle with it on the couch. It should be able to be alone for around 4 hours. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I’m interested in doodles because of their low shedding and because they’re mostly hypoallergenic.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic things like sitting, stopping, standing, etc.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Not really, I’ll just play some things with it sometimes like frisbee, or soccer (if it can move the ball, I’m not smart with dog-related things so I don’t know if dogs can properly play soccer), and maybe bring it into the pool.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I’ll play for around half an hour each day, and I will also walk it for around half an hour each day. On weekends, I’ll probably play with it more. I’ll also just snuggle with it sometimes and might chase it around the backyard sometimes.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* About half an hour of walking and half an hour of playing fetch in the backyard. On weekends, there will probably be around maybe an hour more.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* At maximum once a week. I’d be willing to pay a professional to do it maybe every month or 1 and a half months.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Mini (Around 25 pounds).

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I’d prefer very little shedding, not a lot of barking unless it needs to alert me of something important, and very little slobber.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I’d prefer it, but it’s not too important for me.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I’d prefer a snuggly dog.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I’d prefer one that’s more eager-to-please.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* ANSWER

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Biting, aggressiveness.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Around 4 hours and at a maximum 9 hours on rare occasions.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Most people are in favor of a dog, one of the kids is a little bit scared of dogs, but we’re hoping they’ll get over it when we get our dog. We don’t want to have to do too much maintenance other than cleaning its poop, feeding it, walking it, etc.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they

* No

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Yes (two tweens)

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* USA and no, I’m not aware of any laws banning any breeds.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* An average winter day ranges from around 20 degrees to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. An average summer day ranges from the low 80s to 90s.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* We’d prefer a dog that is less common and that looks like a Bernedoodle or Aussiedoodle.

scrivenerserror,Dog hates her new bed,25,2024-05-12 09:56:53+00:00,"I’m mostly sharing this because it is cute in some ways, but also any advice on fixing the situation is helpful. 

My dog is about 8 and is a rescue. She’s not difficult at all generally outside of not liking seeing other dogs on leash when we walk her (she just barks and pulls - she’s fine with her dog friends and random dogs at daycare). 

Well she’s a digger sometimes in the backyard and particularly, inside, with her doggie bed. Her last two had to be replaced, one most recently this week. We put her blankies on it so it had her smell and the bed is pretty similar to her last one. She dug into that one so much there was foam everywhere all the time. 

She does not like it yet. We coaxed her onto it with treats and she slept on it for a while but it’s about 5am here and she’s still hiding in bed with me because she doesn’t like her bed. Usually she wants us to leave her alone until like 6am when she’s hungry. She’s allowed on the bed so it isn’t a huge deal, but I was wondering how people have gotten their dogs adjusted to a new bed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cq4e7x/dog_hates_her_new_bed/

background info, i work 65 hour weeks (about 50/50 give or take daytime and graveyard) and my boyfriend works from home. whenever im available during the day we’re often running errands and since we’re pretty far from the nearest town we’re often gone for 2 hours or more at a time. we’ve recently moved so the girls cant be outside when we’re not home because our current yard isnt quite airtight, but all of this was the same when we lived in a suburb with a dog door and an airtight yard.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cq0aqi/my_almost_perfect_dog_hates_toys_and_loves_to/

bunwayyyy,How to entertain an old blind dog?,69,2024-05-12 02:05:34+00:00,"My dog recently lost his vision (cataracts, can’t be fixed with surgery) and we’ve been trying to help him adjust. He’s 13, and will be 14 in a couple of weeks. Before this, he wasn’t extremely active, but he still enjoyed roaming around the house, going outside, sitting on our balcony, and just spending time with my dad (who works from home). Now, he’s very cautious with his movements, and I think he’s scared to go around the house. 

He bumps his head into things often, but he’s slowly learning some of his usual routes. The problem is, because of his recent condition, paired with his age, he spends most of his time sleeping. He’s likes to sleep in one area of the house, and I either have to bring him his water dish, or stick close by to help him find it in its usual spot. I’m worried about his mental stimulation, as well as him being overall depressed. 

I’ve tried to spend more time with him outside, such as going on walks (which aren’t very far as he is 13 and has arthritis), and taking him out to our balcony. I talk to him more, even if I’m just passing by, so he knows I’m there, and I’ve been petting him very often to be reassuring. 

Does anyone have any recommendations of something that I could do to help him occupy himself, or build up his confidence at least so he navigates around the house more? I know part of it is his age, and he slept a lot before, but this is mostly all he does outside of me spending time with him. He’s never really been interested in dog toys, and I don’t want to overfeed him with treats, so I’m desperate for options of something that could help. Anything would be appreciated!

localhalloweenskunk,Should I switch to a different boarding facility?,1,2024-05-11 23:43:35+00:00,"Hi. I'm the owner of a six-year old beagle whom I adopted about three months ago. A few weeks ago there was an incident at our boarding facility that is making me question whether I should switch to a different one that is slightly further away.

My beagle stayed the night while we were away, and my mom and I went to pick him up in the morning. The workers brought him out on his leash, but unbeknownst to us, they had attached the leash around the thin key ring holding his tags rather than on one of the slots on his collar. We hadn't thought to check, because we assumed someone wouldn't do this.

My dog's very excitable and was most likely a hunting dog before we got him, so he tends to pull a bit and he runs very faster. He's in his own world when he's tracking. When we got out the door, he pulled hard enough to warp the key ring so that the leash snapped off. The boarding facility is by a business highway, and he took off in that direction. I had to sprint after him, and for some reason he did stop to sniff something, so I was able to grab him, but it was terrifying.

We haven't been back since we have no reason to board him right now, but in a few months we will have to have him stay about a week in a boarding facility. However, the incident makes me reluctant to return to this particular facility. I know logically that it was a mistake, but it was also a ridiculous, potentially fatal mistake, and it makes me cautious to take him back there.

gigglyplatypossumpus,Solution for dog park with poison ivy? ,6,2024-05-11 22:57:53+00:00,"Hi, so I have a min pin mix and we like to go to the dog park regularly. We found a dog park that is enormous. 9 acres of fenced in forest. He has a blast chasing squirrels and birds and meeting new friends. 

Only problem is that there is plenty of poison ivy around (it’s a forest) and I basically can’t prevent him from going through it. 

The good news is that he doesn’t react to it. The bad news is that I do. 

I really want him to enjoy this enormous space where he can run around and be a dog. (We live in a city, open spaces where he can run offleash are rare). It makes him so happy and it gets him running in a way that I can’t. I just don’t know what to do about the poison ivy. 

The past few times, I’ve had technu wipes on hand and wiped him off with that, and a bath when we get home. But now that the weather is getting really nice, I would love to take him more often, but I don’t think it would be good to bathe him multiple times per week. 

I was thinking maybe a playsuit would work so I only have to wash his paws? But I don’t know if that will be too hot for him in the summer and from a safety perspective, he could get caught on something. 

Has anyone come up with a solution for this?

daintyfannyfart,How do you tell if your dog is bored in the car?,63,2024-05-11 22:16:41+00:00,"**Edit**: Thank you all for the feedback!! I greatly appreciate it. 

My dog has no issue jumping into the car. He'll politely sit and wait for me to open the door and then quickly jump in and wait to be buckled up. He has access to a plush bunny that squeeks and a superchew toy incase he gets the need to chew on something. During the car ride, my dog will rotate how he's sitting. He'll sit in the middle of the backseat and watch out the front window. Then he'll turn around and watch out the rear window. At some point, he will lean against the back of my seat and stay there. He does enjoy looking out the window and watching the world go by. He doesn't whine or bark; he'll only bark when people get near the car or he sees another dog.

I was curious if he's bored in the car or just very relaxed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cpsp82/how_do_you_tell_if_your_dog_is_bored_in_the_car/

I’ve been offered a rescue who is 3.5 years old. His first home was not good and he’s afraid of many things. Like men. His foster mom called me last night and we talked a long time about his behaviors and needs. I want him but I’m afraid that I am not experienced enough to be who he needs. The foster mom assured me that I will have support and if in a couple of months it doesn’t seem to be working, she’ll take him back. In my state, if he bites one time he’ll have to be rehomed or euthanized. So his little life is on the line with me.

I have a quiet home with a nice back yard and I want more than anything to love him well so he can have the life he deserves. But I have to remember that for a time, my need for his companionship is secondary to his needs right now. My husband understands that for a time, he’s only to offer a treat quietly when he’s in the dog’s presence until he understands that this man, in this home, is safe.

I have a very socially... confused, 8 pound [Pomeranian](https://imgur.com/gallery/2hGBj2G) with alopecia who tends to bother other dogs during play because can't tell when they're not interested unless they correct him. He is friendly but he is rude - he can be very bossy. Usually this means I end up separating him after a while because I don't want him to be annoying, especially when the dog doesn't do a good job correcting him. I'd say it's 40/60  - 40% of the time he'll meet a dog that's similar to him and they'll be fast friends but the other times, the dog does Not like his energy. 

On the other end, he also has very very high tolerance when it comes to ""obnoxious"" dogs - I've never seen him correct a dog before. Again, I end up just trying to read whether or not he's had enough and he does a good job coming to me when he's had enough play with a dog that might Match his energy too much lol. 

He LOVES puppies. People are shocked when they see him play with them and they beg me to come over for play dates because of how good he is with them. 

Could this be because of his own personality when it comes to play? Would you be concerned about this behaviour?

Some background first:

2 months ago my girlfriend's family got a new dog, Mia. She's 3,5 year old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. They got her from a breeder where she lived with few more cavaliers. They also have 11 year old girl, Penny, of the same breed. The older dog knows me well and likes me. However there is a problem with the new dog. She seems to dislike me passionatelly. Every time I come she barks and growls at me and seems to be scared of me. I usually then sit down on the ground and try to gain her trust and she usually comes for pets but still is very uncertain. Im not leaning over her or making any sudden moves as this makes her scared.

Sometimes when my girlfriend leaves, e.g. to the bathroom, Mia runs to me for cuddles and she is no longer growling or barking.

As far as we are concerned she is protecting my girlfriend. Our current situation looks like this: On weekends she is at her parents home where the dogs are. On sunday evening I come and we drive to our Uni where we live in a dorm. At friday we drive back. It seems like Mia knows that when I come, it usually means Im taking my girlfriend away from her and she lets me know that she doesn't like it. On the other hand, when we are getting back on fridays she usually is calmer.

Last sunday we tried something different. My girlfriend took the dog on a walk and when I came for her we met in front of her house and came in together. This time she was not barking at me outside and when we came inside she initially was calm. After a minute she started growling and when my girlfriend (who scolded her for growling) left to another room, Mia started wildly barking and growling at me.

Mia also barks and growls on my girlfriend's grandparents although it is not as severe as with me. Around them she usually calms down rather quickly. While out on walks she doesn't growl or bark at anyone. She is curious of people and other dogs. 

Scolding her is not working too well because her hearing isn't the best as her veterinarian said.

Question:

How would you approach gaining her trust or getting her calmer with me around? It really means a lot to us for her to like and trust me. We tried to ignore her when she barks and growls, bribe her with pets when she calms down so she associates being calm with pets. But nothing seems to get effects.

I have a very sweet and friendly yellow lab who is 9, she gets along with other dogs well, she's only had problems with 2 other dogs so far and it's usually because the other dog is a bit more aggressive. She backs off though and is fairly submissive.

My friend is staying the night and needs to bring his dog, as he has no one to watch him. He has a golden retriever age range 2-4 (I'm not totally sure but he's young) and he is a super sweet dog too but Idk I'm just worried they won't get along.

Is there anything I can do for when they first meet to make sure they get along?? Maybe outside, throwing a ball around? Or maybe giving them both a pigs ear as they are both very food motivated.

Any advice helps!! Thank you!!!

They love each other!! My dog does not appreciate all of the butt sniffing that my friends dog loves to do but other than that they are getting along really well, for anyone that cares lol!!

i leave the bathroom, and it is quiet. she is fine again. she can be fine with me going to the kitchen, with me walking by and leaving the hall again, but right when i close the bathroom door she is crazy.

jwin709,Feeding schedule for my chiweenie.,2,2024-05-11 13:36:22+00:00,"**TL;DR:** I'm thinking of feeding my dog 1/6cup of food at 5am,9am,1pm, and 5pm. Rather than 2/6cup at 5am, and 5pm. Wondering what people's thoughts are on smaller, more frequent feedings. 


**Here's the background info**

Ive been feeding my chiweenie 1/3 cup of kibble twice a day for about a year now. One serving at 5 am, another serving at 5pm.

Well this past week I got married and we had a lot of people visiting the house and a lot of stuff to do and there were days where I wasn't home at 5pm to serve him. I'd get home at 6 or one day even 7 and I felt so bad for the little guy cause he was SO excited about us getting home and feeding him I never wanted him to have another delayed meal again so I bought him an automatic feeder. 

The portions for this feeder seem to be in 1/6 cup and you can basically set it to dish out as many portions per feeding as you'd like. It does up to 6 meal times per day. 

My question is this. Since I'm giving my dog 2/3 cup of food per day (or 4/6cup), now that I have this feeder should I aim for feeding him 4 × 1/6cup portions per day? 
Like should I feed him at 5am, 9am,1pm,5pm?
Could that be better for his digestion and make him feel more satiated throughout the day? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cpho77/feeding_schedule_for_my_chiweenie/

iminyourdms,[Breeds] We've planned to get a dog at some point in the next few years ,4,2024-05-11 15:43:29+00:00,"My girlfriend and I have planned to get a dog maybe next year or the year after. We both have our preferences and ideas, but we want to have other options about breeds that would suit our life and might be a good choice.
Thank you in advance!
____________________________________

    **Introduction**

    1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

    * Not the first for both of us. I grew up with a Collie and a Hovawart, my girlfriend with a German shepherd. We both also trained them, but nothing more than usual commands.

    2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

    * Both is fine 

    3)	Describe your ideal dog.

    * Ideally a dog that wants to do something and is eager to learn. Should also like contact with humans.

    4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

    * Personally I like larger dogs, my girlfriend prefers mid-sized ones. If I had to choose a specific breed, probably a Tamskan. For my girlfriend it would be an Australian shepherd.

    5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

    * Apart from the basic commands, I'd like the dog to be able to listen to me while running free without a leash. Also anything that stimulates his brain, so he's not bored, though there's nothing specific in that case.

    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

    * No work, also no immediate plans for specific sports. Agility might be a thing we'd interested in, but that's totally new for us.

    **Care Commitments**

      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

    * I work from home, so I do have quite a lot of time to interact with my dog. Ideally I would go for a run or a extended walk before my work, and then devote some time to training or general activities after work.

    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

    * About one hour in the morning and then, depending on the day, maybe up to two more hours over the whole day. I don't have any other commitments, so I can plan time pretty freely.

    9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

    * We brush our cats cats almost daily, so I'm up for some spa time. However, we prefer dogs we shorter (not very short, but also not very long) hair. If needed, we would either trim ourselves or pay someone to do it .

    **Personal Preferences**

    10)	What size dog are you looking for?

    * Mid-sized (Australian shepherd) up to larger (German shepherd or Tamskan)

    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

    * We don't really have a preference here 

    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

    * Important, but not a ko-criteria

    **Dog Personality and Behavior**

    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

    * A snuggly one

    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

    * Hard to decide, probably something in between.
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

    * He should be friendly to people he knows, otherwise being sceptic is okay.

    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

    * I don't know if there are any breeds that are inherently aggressive to othr dogs, but we wouldn't want one.

    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

    * Nope 
    **Lifestyle**

    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

    * During the week probably once for 5 hours, during the weekend maybe once at the beginning evening for a few hours. Not for a extended period of time 

    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

    * None

    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

    * We've got two Maine Coon cats.

    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

    * Yes and no. We don't have children, but at some point in the future we might.

    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

    * No restrictions 

    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

    * Germany, afaik only ""Kampfhunde"" are banned to some extend.

    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

    * About 25-30 Celsius in the summer, in winter more or less around 0 Celsius.

Appropriate-Class644,adopting or buying from a reputable breeder/ rescue in nyc/ nj/ ct?,30,2024-05-11 14:51:53+00:00,"
hi all, my partner (27m) and i (23f) are looking to adopt or possibly buy a small young/adult (no puppies!!) low shedding dog from a reputable breeder / rescue this summer. i’m having trouble deciding which route to take as i was very firm on adopt don’t shop when we initially started talking about getting a dog, but i do have mild allergies to dogs and many shelters/ rescues unfortunately cannot guarantee a dog being hypoallergenic or low shedding. my partner has never had a dog before and i grew up with dogs so we decided to foster first. upon deciding we will foster first, i did a very long deep dive on shelters and rescues in nyc and realized not all of them do the great work we think they do. we also wanted to foster first because im sure rescue get lots of applications for the small young/ adult dogs. 

we’ve currently been fostering with a rescue based in brooklyn. it hasn’t been the best experience with them (no fault of the dog we’re fostering at all!!) which has been disappointing as i was hoping to adopt through them since they had so many small adult dogs coming in each transport but now im not sure if id like to go that route. my fear is medical information being withheld from me / a proper vet check not being completed by the rescue when i do adopt. i also don’t know if ethical breeding does exist anywhere in the nyc/nj/ ct area?  

i’m interested in mini schnauzers, mini poodles, malteses, havanese, cairn terrier, really any small low shedding dog. 

sorry for the long post!! just looking to get a small dog and i want to do it in a way that’s right for both our future dog and for my partner and i  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cpj7w5/adopting_or_buying_from_a_reputable_breeder/

Fxlle_Angel,Dog going absolutely berserk??,1,2024-05-11 14:34:34+00:00,"My husband and I rescued a golden Labrador mix about two to three weeks ago and up until now he has been an angel. Potty trained as soon as we brought him home, does not pull leash , and slept and cuddled most of the day. Now everything has taken a complete 180.

First some background info. Atlas was thrown to the streets by his original family and was later rescued by an unlicensed organization here in Turkey. During his stay he was adopted 3-4 times only to be brought back every time after the first day or two. The day we got him we took him to the vet and they said he was sick (nothing too serious), not to mention he was about 25 pounds lighter than he was suppose to be. He’s almost done with his treatment, and he’s already started gaining weight. 

About the last 2-3 days he’s been all over the place. He’s a very intelligent dog; when he needs to go to the bathroom he barks at the front door. However, lately although he continues to do that he’s started peeing in the house. Usually happens after scolding him for some of his other new behaviors. Today he’s decided he wants to chew through cables and chewed completely through a printer power chord. Last night he attacked all the pillows in the house, trying to rip them apart. Also he tried to dig a hole into the couch. Today he won’t stop barking and running around in circles even though we continuously take him out and walk him and play with him.

Is this his actual personality after settling into his new home and overcoming his sickness? Is it him testing boundaries to see if we’ll keep him? Or is there something else going on?

Dear_Cat_1141,My dog gives me really bad anxiety ,0,2024-05-11 13:42:17+00:00,"I recently got a shiba inu dog and her barks give me really bad anxiety. My dog hates, absolutely loathes her crate. It has only progressively gotten worse. I think I first started having really bad anxiety on my dog's first night when we just bought her home. It was in the wee hours of the morning, at 3am when she started to whimper and whine. At first, I ignored it as ignoring your dog's whimper was something I always saw when  I was researching on how to train your dog. But I eventually relented as her whimpers became unbearable, I took her out and let her run around in a vain attempt to tire her out but it backfired she ended up screaming, doing the classic shiba inu scream in the wee hours of the morning. In addition to this, I have neighbours who live in close proximity, super close. Which is really bad in my case as my neighbours arent huge fans if dogs. I started to feel really anxious, it felt like I had a crazy amount of adrenaline which rushed up to my brain making my brain feel all hot and mushy, I feel really nauseated and I can't help but fast from stress losing my appetite. I feel super afraid of the night as I worry that my dog will bark again. I have no idea why she whines even outside of her cage, we try to play eith her but she won't settle. I get so very anxious everything I hear a hight pitched sound be it a dog whimper or not, even if it is just kids screaming or the chair scarping across the floor. I feel like every fibre of my body and all my cells scream when I hear a high pitched sound. Sometimes, i have auditory hallucinations, where i imagine hearing dog whimpers. It has gotten really bad with my dog, she is becoming increasingly more vocal and whiney as time passes. I have tried to engaged professional trainers in an attempt to help curb it and try to understand her more. But I can't get rid of this severe feeling of anxiety. It's the worse I have ever felt. I feel nauseated every time I see my dog and it fills home with so much guilt. I don't know how to approach or face her anymore. It made me wonder if I was really cut out for a dog, it has always been my dream to have one, I have finally become financially stable and done ample research, I always watch dog training videos. But I think reality is often cruel, I can't seem to manage my dog at all, I don't even know where to begin or how to begin. All I have is honestly just really strong and overwhelming feelings of stress and anxiety. I hope I can give her a good home, I hope the trainings will make me more confident. Bit now, I just feel like a big mess. Sorry for the long passage, I really am at my ends wits, if anybody have had the same experience please do share with me, how I can better help my dog and myself and how to overcome my fear of my dog's bark and even honestly her hyper personality.

Maleficent_Dog1551,Golden Retriever despises walks,10,2024-05-11 10:01:10+00:00,"My one-year-old golden retriever despises going on walks; he much prefers staying indoors all day. He waits until he can hardly contain his need to pee or poo before signaling his desire to go outside. When we attempt to take him for walks, he stubbornly refuses to move from his spot, requiring significant coaxing and pulling before reluctantly getting up. I suspect our previous use of a choke collar during training may be the cause of his aversion. Upon realizing his discomfort with the choke collar, we promptly ceased using it. Additionally, I am making every effort to ensure our walks are enjoyable for him. I allow him to explore and sniff to his heart's content, avoiding excessive control. Our walks typically take place around a park right in front of our home, with one lap around the park measuring approximately 300 meters. Despite this short distance, he quickly tires and insists on returning home after just one lap. Although I have consulted with a vet to rule out any leg problems, he appears to be in good health. Could his reluctance simply be due to laziness?

Chenoa_Odd,My pup won’t relieve herself on hikes or walks.,8,2024-05-11 11:22:34+00:00,"So as of right now I have a 20 week old German Shepherd Siberian Husky mix puppy. Her potty training is going really well she almost never relieves herself in the house unless she gets too excited or something/someone scares her. 

I usually take her on a walk around the block, but she only relieves herself in one area of the walk. It’s a nice grassy area and not on someone’s yard so I really appreciate it when she goes there. But I’d like her to get use to going to different places too. I did switch up our walks completely avoiding her favorite area to see if she would go but she wouldn’t go unless we went to her favorite spot.

She and I have gone on several hikes now. We usually go to two different places and that’s it. So she is familiar with both of them. But she refuses to relieve herself unless we go back home to her spot or we hit a river or lake. 

She loves the water and likes to play it and do her puppy thing. Although I’m pretty sure she only does that to make me think she’s not going to relieve herself in the water, which is usually when she decides to go. 

Anyway my problem here is my pup refuses to relieve herself unless it’s her favorite spot or a body of water. I’m not sure why she would choose a body of water to be a good place to relieve herself but she does. We can go on a several hour hike, plenty of spots to go, I give her plenty of water, and plenty of time to find a spot to go. Yet she chooses to hold it in. 

Any help or advice, would be greatly appreciated. She is my first dog and I’ve been doing a lot of research with training. I’ve done some research on our problem here too, yet found nothing so I’m hoping for any help.

SirBudnChuff,Sometimes she does sometimes she doesn’t ,5,2024-05-11 13:24:34+00:00,"Sorry if this is in the wrong section it’s literally my first post on Reddit. 
Possibly a super naive question here but I can’t find anything definitive anywhere else so; my big girl she’s a Neo-mastiff/canecorso/doguedebordeaux, her paperwork says bandog but that’s her bloodline as we were told. Sometimes she’s comfortable with other dogs sniffing her from behind  and then other times everything’s all good until they smell her bum? It seems to happen more so when she’s on a lead than off but generally because of her size people are apprehensive when they see us coming even though she’ll walk right beside me until I tell her she can go ahead so I generally lead her around people/dogs we walk past unless it’s obvious that things seem fine (I trust my girl but I always have doubts about others) but she doesn’t get aggressive, just flinches if you know what I mean and once they start smelling somewhere else she’s fine, my guess is she purely doesn’t want to be sniffed by some dogs and others she does? She’s also spayed by a year or so. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cphg2i/sometimes_she_does_sometimes_she_doesnt/

Alvin has swam before but he doesn’t really do it willingly. I can only recall one time it’s been on purpose, he was swimming after a kayak (in freshwater, also it was ours so he wasn’t chasing random people). He will drink from the hose so he’s not really afraid of that, but I think it’d be nice if the both of them were comfortable cooling off in water during the hot summer.

Coughyyy,Dog Randomly Doesn’t Want to Use My Backyard anymore ,1,2024-05-11 12:26:19+00:00,"As the title states, my dog is now refusing to use my backyard. Since i’ve gotten her she has loved my fenced in backyard. It’s large with a lot of space to run and have fun. But very recently she has decided she doesn’t want to go out there anymore. She will just stand at the door when I open it or just walk onto my patio and then back inside. I take her on 2 - 30 minute walks a day and she is still willing and happy to go on them. She is eating twice a day and drink water normally as well. So i’m just so confused at why she doesn’t want to go out there anymore.  Any insight on what is going on is greatly appreciated.

lillyconee,Lost and Found: A Heartbreaking Journey of Farewell,1,2024-05-11 07:37:36+00:00,"During my recent vacation, tragedy struck with the unexpected passing of my beloved furry friend. It was a gut-wrenching blow that left me reeling with guilt and heartache.

You see, I had entrusted my energetic three-year-old pup to a caregiver while I was away. However, upon my return, I received distressing news. The caregiver informed me that my sweet pup had been incredibly restless, barking incessantly, and even managed to escape her enclosure. Despite their best efforts, they couldn't calm her down.

Feeling helpless, I arranged for her to be relocated to a different place, hoping to alleviate her anxiety. But fate had a cruel twist in store for us. The following morning, I received a heart-wrenching text—she had escaped once again.

My heart shattered into a million pieces as I rushed back home, consumed by worry and regret. In a desperate search, I scoured the neighborhood, praying for her safe return. But my worst fears were realized when I stumbled upon the devastating sight of her lifeless body by the roadside.

The pain of her loss is indescribable. She was more than just a pet; she was family—a source of joy, love, and unwavering loyalty. Now, the guilt weighs heavy on my heart. The thought of her wandering alone, frightened and confused, tears me apart.

I can't help but blame myself. Should I have made different arrangements? Could I have prevented this tragedy? These questions haunt me day and night, tormenting me with their unanswered echoes.

As I grapple with my grief, I'm left with a profound sense of emptiness. The memories of our adventures, our playful moments, now serve as bittersweet reminders of what once was.

In her absence, the world feels a little darker, a little colder. But her spirit lives on in my heart, a beacon of love and light that will never fade. And though she may be gone, she will never be forgotten.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cpc161/lost_and_found_a_heartbreaking_journey_of_farewell/

Shounenbat510,Question About References,1,2024-05-11 02:56:55+00:00,"I'm thinking I'm ready for a dog again, but I'm wanting to get a puppy from a breeder this time.  The only problem is, most of them seem to want references.  I work from home and literally haven't spoken to anyone outside of immediate family in over ten years.  I won't go into why or anything, but that's my situation.

I have cats right now because someone must've dumped some around where I live and a mom had kittens in the yard.  It suits me fine because I depend on animals to keep me company and to help me strike up conversations with people when I, but I don't know how to explain it to a potential breeder.

Anyone else in this situation?  I understand that they want their puppers to go to a good home and like people to vouch for buyers, but not everyone has that kind of a social life.

While she was sick, she had problems controlling her pee and marked a few spots in the house as a result. One of those spots our senior dog seems to have taken to, and when we are not home, he will often pee on that spot. We caught him on one of our cams in the act. It doesn’t seem like incontinence. It seems like he seeks it out and marks it. Any ideas how to play this? At his recent physical, he didn’t have any signs of a UTI or anything like that. It just seems like he thinks that’s a community pee spot. It’s a sitting chair on an area rug. I’ve also caught him peeing in a couple other areas in the house, but with much less frequency in the same area the cat had issues. My thought was we get the area professionally cleaned in the hope that gets rid of whatever’s attracting him to that spot?

He is a poodle/pomeranian mix. I spent 10k to get a  malignant mass removed from his intestines a few years ago, I was told if it wasn't removed he'd only live 4 more months (that was 4 yrs ago thanks to that surgery). He suffers from regular seizures (he is on meds) he is now going blind, has stage 1 chronic kidney disease and arthritis. I spend a lot of money on his monthly meds and prescription food. 

My main issue is: I don't mind spending the money for his care, what is starting to become a lot are his needs, anxiety, & agression. I can't have people over bc he barks literally nonstop, he is only calm if I am with him 1-on-1. He tries to bite people if they come near and has bitten me multiple times when I try to put him away to his bed. He is a grumpy old man...my life literally revolves around him. I work night shift at the hospital because he can't be home alone during the day. I can't board him bc of his anxiety and I know he will be miserable there. I feel like I'm at my wits end...I love him and I feel like such a bad person for even considering this.

We have been working with trainer for the last month and she has determined that she knows her commands, she is just so stubborn she will not do them unless motivated.

My boyfriend ended up popping her butt, she didn’t care.. there was nothing keeping this dog from this stick. We put her in her crate and she sat with the stick for a solid half an hour in her mouth. 
Our trainer said she’s a smart dog, she knows what she needs to do she’s just very very stubborn.

This has led to her occasionally peeing inside the car, I put down a blanket and puppy pads to mitigate any damage to the car, but this underlying issue is still a bit hard for me as it makes our journeys out together a lot more stressful as she holds it in.

Mariyyaax,Breed questionnaire ,15,2024-05-10 18:11:11+00:00,"**COPY/PASTE THE FOLLOWING FOR AUTO-FORMAT WITH BULLETS** 

I really hope that someone will be able to give me some solid advice on breeds as I am going round and round in circles trying to decide. I am based in Scotland, UK. 

    1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

    No. I used to have a golden retriever who was amazing. I have also looked after a Pomeranian long term and a jack Russell mix with a poodle on many occasions. 

    2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

    I don't mind either, but I'm struggling to find a dog that is suitable for me from a rescue shelter. 

    3)	Describe your ideal dog.

  * We need a dog that is low shed as my husband has allergies to some dogs (no allergies to his own spaniel and jack Russell cross, but very allergic to our friend's Labrador). 

* Looking for a medium sized dog as we live in an apartment (a large apartment but still apartment. 

* Because of living in an apartment we probably need a breed that is not known to be noisy. 

* We both work full time, however I am going to be hiring a dog walker to walk the dog during the day and will hopefully be able to drop the dog off with my mum once a week whilst we are at work. However, the dog will need to be alone for up to about 3 hours during the day. 

* We are hoping to have children in the future, so would need a dog that is good with children. 

* I would like to have a fairly active dog that we can take on long walks and play with daily. However, if we are not able to go on a long walk daily (sometimes Scottish weather can be horrible!!) it shouldn't impact the dog's mental health hugely. 


    4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

    *I love long haired dogs, and my favourite dog ever is a golden retriever but it's not feasible for us to have one with my husband's allergy and living in an apartment.I have been looking at the poodle cross breeds (cockapoo and cavapoo) because of their low shedding, and also at schnauzers. However I have read that poodle crosses aren't always the healthiest dogs, and some posts have said they suffer really badly from separation anxiety. I have also been looking at whippets and really like them, but I'm worried that the areas around our apartment aren't suitable. We live next to two large parks, but they are also next to a busy road and I've read that whippets can have bad recall so I would be worried about letting them off the leash there. 

    5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

    *I would like to have solid recall training down. I don't care about tricks, but I want to make sure that my dog will listen to me no matter what in case of an emergency (eg traffic, another dog or animal approaching) 
    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

    * No. I would ideally like to eventually jog and hike with my dog, but it's not a complete necessity. 

    **Care Commitments**

      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

    * At least one hour a day. After work and on weekends I will be secored to my dog. 

    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

    * Around an hour not including the dog walker during the day. We have two large parks next to us so I plan on going there on weekdays and for forest walks/hikes/ to the beach/dog park on weekends. 

    9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

    * I'm happy to do all grooming- I know poodle breeds need brushing every day and I am happy to do that. 

    **Personal Preferences**

    10)	What size dog are you looking for?

    * Medium 

    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

    * No shedding due to husband's potential allergy and minimal barking due to neighbours .Don't care about slobber. 

    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

    * Quite important. The parka near us have fences, but not everywhere. 

    **Dog Personality and Behavior**

    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

    * Snuggly all the way!

    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

    * Eager to please 
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

    * I don't mind if it's excited or indifferent. However, I will be socialising it from a young age to ensure that it is not afraid of visitors. 

    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

    * Yes, but I will be reaching out to get some professional help as I would want to make sure I'm doing everything right in that situation. 

    17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

    * My biggest fear is separation anxiety. I can't stand the thought of my dog being distressed whilst I'm not at home which is why I will make sure someone is there for them for at least few hours a day before I come home. I have been waiting so long to have a dog, and my job will never be available as a work from home job, but there will be days that I'll be able to get away earlier and also I will be off during the school holidays. 

    **Lifestyle**

    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

    * Monday-Friday for up to 3 hours at a time eventually. Initially when it's a puppy I'll be asking my mum to stay with it and I'll be training the dog to feel comfortable with being left alone over several months. Then I'll get a dog walker, which will mean the dog should only be alone for around 3 hours at a time. 

    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

    * My husband is happy to be involved and will be popping home during the day too as he works close by, however I will be doing most of the training as I really enjoy that aspect of dog ownership.

lunalenayga,Randomly attacked plushie,1,2024-05-10 18:15:42+00:00,"I've had my dog for over a year now and she has never showed any interest in any type of toy we give her, not plushies, squeaker, ropes, balls, nada. Yesterday I went out for 2 hours (partner was still home) and she went into my office (where she usually hangs out and has a bed in) and took a small penguin plush off my bookshelf. 

She did not chew the toy except to meticulously pull out the plastic eyeballs. She then left the plush just laying menacingly on the ground near her bed surrounded by its eyeballs like a serial killer posed it lmao. I am so confused as to why she did this. 

I have since pulled a few of her own toys into the area around her bed to hopefully save another plush from the same fate, but I'm so confused as to why she would all of a sudden do something so odd. She has shown no interest in her own toys and had never shown any interest in any of mine prior to this. Her previous owner said she didn't play with toys when they had her either (she is a 7 year old rescue). 

Any ideas? On prevention, cause, anything? I don't want another crime scene on my hands lol

Tldr: my dog has never shown any interest in plushies (hers or mine) until she seemingly randomly decided to pull only the eyes out of one of my plushes. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cow6ke/randomly_attacked_plushie/

Maelstrom_Witch,Adopting a beagle - do you have any tips that I can’t find with Google?,2,2024-05-10 17:56:54+00:00,"Hello! My husband and I are adopting a beagle today. We’ve already met the pup, he’s about a year old. He spent a few days here last week so we could see what pup-proofing (HA) we needed before he came home for good. 

He’s going to have a nice crate and an x-pen area in the house for when we are at work (about 6 x 7 feet, 42” tall), and he’s going to be heavily supervised as we have 2 cats in the house. The cats have the upper floor of the house to themselves & my teen son currently, with a baby gate at the bottom of the stairs so pup can’t chase them. Although he likes to bark at them, the dog I mean, not my kid 😂 so we keep a blanket over the gate to minimize the visual temptation for now. 

In addition to keeping the house pup-safe, I have already found that he is super super smart, and very good motivated so he figures our basic puzzle feeders pretty quickly.  Is it ok to feed him entirely by puzzles or food-dispensing toys?

I’ve also read that beagles should be on-leash unless in a fenced-in area, which my husband seems a bit disappointed about, as he wants Crash (the dog) to be able to do a lot of running if he wants. Our back yard is safe, however it’s configured in a way that the dog can’t really reach maximum speed. Do y’all take any tips for letting the dog run safely? 

I’m happy to answer any further question too. We’ve had a dog previously, a rottie/hound cross, who was a beloved pet & snuggle monster but not nearly as smart as this new addition will be.

Meet Milou, my spirited pup who's about to turn 5 months old. I adopted her 1 month ago from a rescue shelter in Hungary. 

Video of her: https://imgur.com/a/sNwlDcg

Her origin story remains a mystery, as she was found alongside her two siblings, that look nothing like her!

The rescue team hazarded a guess at her birth date and speculated she's a blend of Pekingese and Maltese, given her initial fluffiness. 

Well, I'm not entirely convinced. She boasts a more athletic build, with long legs and predominantly straight fur, save for her adorable ears.

She absolutely adores the outdoors, is a natural climber and avid digger. What's truly remarkable is her nose work—Milou's adept at searching and has quite the talent for it.

My dog recently passed away she was a beautiful Australian shepherd, she was only 10 years old. She had to have emergency surgery yesterday and after the surgery the vet said she was fine. Unfortunately this morning she passed away as her body was just to weak to carry on.

The reason I mentioned I was a service member is because we had my dog for 10 years and me and her were inseperable growing up. She was my best friend and I was hers. I graduated highschool 2 years ago and joined the Army and I have been unable to see her face to face since. Ive only seen her and talked to her on Facetime.

I just feel so guilty and ashamed that I wasn’t there for her in her final moments. She was always there for me anytime my life got hard and she could tell I was upset or something was wrong and always knew how to cheer me up but I couldn’t be there for her to let her know everything was okay and that I loved her.

I dont know if she thought I abandoned her or didnt love her or what and its eating at me inside. She was my first pet and the last one I will ever own. No other animal can ever replace her and it’s killing me that I wasn’t there and I couldn’t help her.

She passed in a unfamiliar place alone and probably scared and im ashamed of myself for not doing everything I could to be there for her.

I live in a house with 2 other housemates. I have a dog and a cat, one other roommate has a dog, and the third roommate has a cat. We all have our own rooms.

The issue is that my housemates dog, Z, has decided that my bedroom is the best place to pee. She has started peeing on my carpet near my bed or in my closet 3x or more a week. She is 4 ish years old and previously very house broken but she isn’t the easiest dog to train. We joke that she’s more cat than dog. We have a doggy door that goes into our backyard that they always have access to. So it’s not an issue of access to a bathroom area. She spends a lot of time outside. 

We’ve tried keeping my door shut, but this isn’t always possible. Z sneaks in my room even if I’ve left it open for just a few moments and I’m getting frustrated with having to remember to keep my door shut 24/7. I also have always preferred to keep my door open as my cat has several favorite napping spots in my room, and i don’t want to lock him in or out away from his litter box (outside of my bedroom). 

Does anyone have any ideas of how to keep just one dog out of a bedroom? Or even just having an alarm go off when she goes into my bedroom would be helpful so we could quickly remedy the issue. We mostly work from home during the days, but she is very sneaky!! Any suggestions would be awesome ◡̈ ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1costac/roommates_dog/

xVedriti,[HELP] New GSD won't leave one of my two cats alone.,4,2024-05-09 20:49:10+00:00,"This is more of a last ditch effort before my mom decides to re-home Lady who we adopted from my elderly grandfather five months ago.

Some background information on Lady;

She's roughly seven years old and was kept outside on a one-two acre lot for the majority of her lifetime without any interaction towards other animals. I honestly don't even think she got proper interaction from people, as she just sat outside all the time and paced, barked, and chewed whatever she could up. This is one of the reasons we ended up taking her aside from her becoming too much for him to handle. I do believe she has seen kittens around his house, as there were strays, and she has seen deer and hogs; both of which she would growl and bark at. That's about all the animal social interaction she received.

She does have a very severe case of separation anxiety, but she has been doing a lot better about not tearing things up while my mom and I are out of the house. She also gets along with her two younger sisters that my older brother owns, with mild scruffles here and there that we are trying to correct.

The biggest issue with her is her behavior towards my 9-10 year old cat, Angel.

She has never attacked either of my cats, at most, she will follow one around the house consistently and jump at both of them if they jump on or off the furniture. We're trying to find a way to get her to stop following Angel around, because she will stare her down from the other side of the room and stalk towards her. The best way I can describe it is to look at videos of animals stalking towards their prey. That is exactly what she does, and she will lick her lips, too. She will occasionally put Angel's head in her mouth which we will immediately call her away from her if we see her doing it.

I won't lie, it does worry me a lot, especially because of the fact that if she really wanted to, she could end up killing my cat.

What confuses me, though, is that she only behaves that way towards this cat specifically. She will not do it to Snowball. Yes, she'll nibble on her ear and/or put it in her mouth. But it doesn't seem like she's being aggressive by any means towards her. I've even seen Lady lick Snowball's head and it seems very sweet and gentle. Those two will lay side-by-side sometimes and Lady doesn't mess with Snowball when she chases her out of my room and swats at her.

But if Angel swats at her or growls, she just seems to get more aggravating towards her.

I don't know if this is a playful behavior? If she is trying to play with Angel because she knows she doesn't like her. I am not confident enough in dog body languages to say that she is playing with her; it sometimes feels like she just wants to eat her.

I think she's a reactive dog in terms of chasing anything that runs. Kids, cats, dogs; she doesn't like when things move fast. That's something I noticed a while back. It's probably got something to do with her upbringing, cause there were lots of deer, hogs, stray dogs, etc.

She seems to completely forget herself when she sees or hears another dog that isn't her sisters (and she does this with Angel, too). I'm talking tripping over her own feet and constantly looking at all sides. I've walked her in the neighborhood and she's only done that once when we saw a bulldog being walked. She didn't necessarily stop, but she wouldn't take her eyes off them. Didn't growl, didn't bark, and if anything she picked up her pace but stopped a little bit too as if she didn't know what to do. And then when we heard dogs barking around us, she seemed almost confused and maybe skittish? Again, picked up her pace away from the sound/dogs, almost as if she didn't want to stick around there.

It makes me wonder a lot of things. But I'm just looking for as much advice as possible, because I genuinely don't want to get rid of Lady if we can do something to break this habit with Angel. Getting a proper trainer for her is not something that I am able to do at this exact moment, as much as I want to. I do not have the funds at this time. My fear is that we'd be setting her up for failure if we did re-home her instead of actively try to correct this behavior.

And getting rid of Angel is also off the table. She doesn't like people at all, and it took her several years to get used to me and we had her since the day she was born. It's just the way she's been since a kitten. I don't think anyone would want her, and I don't want to set her up for failure in a new home. Besides, I love that cat with my entire heart, just as much as I love Lady.

Does anyone have any advice at all?


** In terms of correcting her behavior, we've taught her the ""leave it"" command, which she listens to for a minute or two and then goes right back. We also have a beeping/vibration collar that we use, since she doesn't like the feeling of the vibration, and she's gotten to the point that if she feels that vibration then she will come to us and lay down for about 10-15 minutes unless someth distracts her (i.e someone walking into the room or a noise at the door).",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1co7lpd/help_new_gsd_wont_leave_one_of_my_two_cats_alone/

For the five years I have had him, I have taken him on multiple walks a day.

The problem is... He has always been a really territorial dog and he LOVES peeing over things on walks to mark his territory. Therefore, he hasn’t been peeing or pooping in our yard hardly, since it doesnt have any smells from other dogs. It’s like he is trying to save it for marking his territory. He literally won’t pee for 20 minutes and we will just be sitting there blankly in the yard. 

My question is— how can I get him to start peeing and pooping freely? My only idea is to literally have other dogs come mark their territory all over the yard so that it will motivate him, but I dont think doing that once is going to permanently solve the issue. Anyone have any ideas? Thanks in advance!

Kind_Possible5231,Dog doesn’t go outside the home much after dog attack,6,2024-05-10 01:34:05+00:00,"

I have two rescue dogs (cattle dog mixes), one is very reactive to other animals, the other absolutely loves them. Both of them get along well and I’ve had zero issues with them together, my reactive one actually gets separation anxiety when my other one is away or out on a walk. 

The other day I was walking my friendly dog on a leash in my neighborhood, and a reactive dog off leash came from around the corner and attacked my dog. My dog is very submissive and did not fight back. The reactive dog latched onto her neck and finally the owner arrived to help separate after I was screaming for someone to help me. The other owner got pretty cut up and bitten from separating them, my hands were a bit cut up after as well. My dog was in rough shape but is okay and will heal just fine however I am truly traumatized from this. It’s been a few weeks and I took her in to get to nails trimmed and it was almost unbearable, the anxiety I had is something I’ve never felt, even with all dogs being leashed in the room. 

Since this, our walks have stopped, both dogs really don’t get out of the house. I have a large fenced yard and we play fetch a lot, we do a lot of mental enrichment a multiple times a day, but I feel like a horrible dog mom. I don’t know how to get over the fear and anxiety I have from the attack. Is there more I can be doing at home to give them a fulfilling life? Is it horrible to not walk them? I didn’t walk my reactive dog as much, she is just so happy playing in the yard and will run and run and run, so I am less worried about her but I still feel bad.

I’m thinking about giving her away because I can’t keep doing this. I can’t close the door because I live in a really hot country and my room is the only one with a ceiling fan and the coldest room in the house so they stay there. And if I do close the door she uses the couch 😔

Any advice? I have tried with cameras and she still uses my bed. I even cover my bed with stuff so she can barely jump and nothing stops her. And it’s not all the time just certain days ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cobu8f/dog_wets_my_bed/
thrindis,Hot pavement dog shoes,1,2024-05-09 21:16:06+00:00,"I’m looking for shoes for my dog to wear on hot pavement, live in California Valley so temps get over 110°F. I don’t like the bulky stiff soled shoes as I think they affect a dogs foot/toe placement and my dogs long hare type feet don’t fit them well. Her nails, even when kept very short, hit the front too much.

I really really like the LavaSox design however I just bought the Large size based on their chart and they are so small! I even gave buffer room when I used the chart (I have a large 85lbs GSD mix) but when I received the shoe it’s like even a small 30lbs corgi wouldn’t fit in the large. Going to try XL but I’m not hopeful just based on how small the L was. It’s like they didn’t take into account when adding a foot to the shoe, the width decreases as the pocket fills out. It also has no elastic, which I think helps keep it in place, but it has zero give. 

Anyways… anyone know anything similar to the LavaSox—super light weight, stays on well, and has a protective base but not a sole that prevent the toes from doing their thing? I don’t need shoes for prolonged exposure to pavements at such a high temp but would like to cross parking lots, get to trail heads, 20-30 mins of walk to restaurants, parks etc. on pavement. I love the material of the lava sox as it’s very breathable. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1co8955/hot_pavement_dog_shoes/

I adopted a 7 month pup (now 10 mo) who seemed to love her ppl and I love her but she's not cuddly and training is hard of course - socialized her consistently but she has reactivity issues.

Also adopted a lil playmate who's sweet, cute, happy and will spend a little time on my lap; I feel that any normal person would love this guy.

Watching my 2 happy pups play together has made me sadder and lonlier than ever. 😢 Strangely I wish I had found a sad lil dog that just wanted love, comfort, reassurance and lots of cuddles.

I feel dumb, like I failed and like a bad person bc no matter how much love and care I give these pups, I don't feel much connection- I feel emptier than ever.

Pls don't judge, I tried to be self aware and make good decisions; How do you know how to feel until it's been a couple weeks?

AgentCreative3360,My dogs dont listen,2,2024-05-10 12:42:51+00:00,"I have 2 male dogs (both intact), dog A is 2 years old border collie/labrador and dog B is 19 months old labrador. I have had dog A since he was 10 weeks old but dog B since he was 1 year old.
I live on a “farm” - only like 10 houses and lots of land with rocks and moss. So they are 90% of the time not on lease.
I dont enjoy walking with them on lease because there is only 1 short road (basically can walk about 1km) and they pull a lot. If i walk on the land then the lease is always getting stuck on rocks and trees.

Dog A
He is a veeery smart dog and really easy to train new tricks but he barks at everything and nothing. If a family member or a car drives by he goes crazy. I have tried to redirect him with sounds and “quiet” and treats/his regular food but nothing seems to last. Sometimes he listens but then just continues barking after getting the treat.

Dog B
Is a very good dog listens to me inside but has a hard time learning new tricks. He rarely barks.

Recently both my dogs have started running away to the neighbors house and also to an area near a lighthouse. At first i thought it was because the neighbors dog was in heat but the owner said she wasnt. I try to call them, whistle, bribe with toys and nothing seems to catch their attention they are too focused on sniffing something. They even do this after a 20minutes fetch session.

So I am posting here because I do not know what to do and I am losing my mind over them and therefore not enjoying what time I have with them outside of work. Please give me any advice you have thanks for reading.

However, I'm a serial walker, I like to do 5-8 miles. Bulldogs are not built for that stress to their joints; but I work from home so we've been doing a lot of bonding. Also, I don't want to leave him alone, he likes to chew on things.

Comfortable_Arm4002,[Help] Stray dog does not leave my house and found a way into my backyard,27,2024-05-10 02:40:14+00:00,"I have 3 dogs, 2 female and 1 male.
Kali one of the female dogs is in heat,  this little guy  found us while we were walking in the park near my house and followed us all the way home, since then he's been waiting for her every night. This has been going on for 4 days now.
Today he figured out a way to get in the backyard. 

We have tried shoo him way but he it did not work, my neighbors have thrown water on him and shoo him with a sticks ( which I think it's awfull) but he keeps coming back. He's not scared of anything.
Today he followed me around all afternoon everytime I left the house.

(I'm not worried abt him mounting my dog bc she's a bernese mountain dog and he is a tiny little guy).

I'm thinking of calling animal services but I'm pretty sure he has a ""owner"" bc he's super clean, no bugs, well fed and it's VERY common for owners to let their dogs free in the streets here. I'm scared if I call them they'll take him to a shelter or wtv and the owners won't know.
It's honestly breaking my heart bc he's a very sweet pup, he loves pets and cuddles and he follows me around every where. I can see him sitting outside waiting at the door from my window rn at 3am, and its taking everything inside of me not to let him in the room to sleep w me , but this can not keep happening bc he will bark and make all the dogs in the neighborhood go crazy he got in all my neighbors backyards and if he gets in mine and my male dog happens to be there, with kali (on heat), I'm pretty sure there will be a problem and this tiny guy fits in my dogs mouth so...

Side note: he has been in the neighborhood for a good while (when he comes with is to the park people recognize him) and he is always looking super well taken care of.
This is what's making me believe he does have a owner.

Special-Reaction3258,Dogs grieving their owners,8,2024-05-10 06:11:16+00:00,"My husband passed away a couple of days ago after a long battle with cancer. Our dog absolutely adored him. He was the one going to puppy classes with him, they played... Until my husband was too weak for that.

Ori whined a lot the night before it happened and he was restless.
I let him see my husband after he passed because I heard it helps dogs understand. He wanted to lick his face really bad, something he loves doing.

Ori now doesn't eat his kibble (we fill his bowl once a day and he usually eats at night, usually he eats everything in his own pace). I understand it's a natural reaction, just like in people.

He has access to outside, my grandad takes him to our neighbor's grassy yard, so he actually has more exercise than in the past few months when I've been busy with taking care of my husband. He can come to me whenever he likes.

I share a deep bond with Ori but right now are the early days and I don't really function much. I'd love to take him for a walk but I'm just... Not in that state yet. He sleeps in my bed with me and he comes for cuddles throughout the day, I also play with him when I have a bit of energy. I was Ori's main caretaker for the past 1.5 years (diagnosis came when he was about 7 months old) so I think he is just grieving his ""dad"", it's not like we don't have a bond.

WineAt4,Advice please: talk me out of this... or into it,11,2024-05-09 19:47:18+00:00,"My beloved little Buddy (abandoned rescue at a year-ish old) crossed the bridge about 6 weeks ago after almost 14 years with me. I am devastated by his loss, of course, and since then feeling just lost. I have had a dog or dogs (like 3-4 at a time) in my life for more than 40 years and I simply don't know how to BE without a dog.  Every minute of every day I'm looking for that wagging tail and listening for the tag jingles. I have 2 cats (rescued at 1 week old 7 years ago, never known life without dogs) who I adore. But they aren't dogs. I know you guys get that distinction.

I'm 71 years old and in quite good health. No reason to think I don't have at least another good 10 active years but I also know that can change real fast. It can for anyone at any age but at 71, yeah, I'm pushing it. There is nothing sadder than a dog who has lost its human - something I feel intensely. It's a big reason I'm so conflicted now. Am I being asshole selfish in even considering adopting another dog?

I have a dog ready home with a secure (for small dog, like under 30 pounds) fenced area that I share with my bestie/next door neighbor who has 2 little guys who are always ready to play with new friends. I'm retired so home 24/7 and if I go, my dog goes too. All of my dogs have been rescues of varying ages and backgrounds so I'm skilled in handling emotionally fragile and sensitive issues.

Last night on the news I see the city shelter is at crisis level due to all the flooding recently. They are pleading for homes. I looked and there are several small older (3+ years) dogs who would be good possibilities for a fit. Just had a long talk with my bestie with a request to talk me out of doing this until I can decide if I'm doing it for the right reason and not just selfishness and grief. Didn't get the response I requested/expected. She told me to get my shoes and keys, we're going RIGHT NOW to get me a dog cuz I NEED a dog. LOL

I asked for 24 hours. If I go, there is a 100% chance that I will return home with a dog. There is no ""Just go look and see."" What say you dog Redditors? I need to hear the arguments pro and con. Should I do this?

UPDATE: I kinda hesitate to update this because what happened was the damnedest thing. Not an hour affter I posted this I was sitting on my porch feeding my squirrel friends. A car drove up in front of my place and a lady hopped out and asked ""remember me?"" A couple of months ago (not long before my Buddy passed) this lady walked by with 5 chihuahuas attached to a spaghetti mess of leashes. My bestie and I were out there and of course went all googoo over them. Only time I ever met her.

To make a long story shorter, this woman has been a small, home breeder of Russian Toy terriers (they look like chihuahuas but aren't actually related) for a number of years. Last year she lost her husband and has just received very bad medical news for herself. She has to part with her 9 adults. She said she thought of us and asked if I would be interested/willing to adopt one of her kids. I was so stunned, like seriously this is happening right now? 

I'm now mom to 2 Russian Toy girls (ages 4 and 5) who she didn't want to separate. Never did make it to the shelter which I feel kinda bad about due to level of relative immediate need of the dogs involved. But when the stars align so dramatically it seems unwise to argue it. (I would post a pic but I can't see a way to do that.)

Emalf-vi,My dog ​​doesn't like other females around me......I like it but I don't know if I should worry about it,14,2024-05-10 13:44:45+00:00,"I never noticed this before, like, there were never women in my house And when have, she always got along very well with them (my relatives that she knew them since she was a pup, like ma mom ,step mom and aunts).

But now that I'm single (I only have relationships with men so she never attacked them either) I decided to have a movie night with some friends who came to visit my city

We were in the middle of a horror movie night When one of my female friends ended up hugging me during the jumpscare, and when my dog ​​saw her hugging me, She didn't attack her, but she kept trying to get her off me, she bit the clothes , took her off me as if she were carrying a car tire, amd sent her to the floor ( My dog ​​is not a BIG dog, my friend that is only 1.55 tall and weighs less than 80 kilos, its easy for her) And then she got on my lap and looked at my friend on the floor , My friend tried to go back to the sofa, but my dog ​​started growling at her and only stopped when she sat down on the armchair, changing places with a guy (another friend) who was there before

(I have to say that when this happened we were laughing our asses off, so we didn't stop her from  doing this)

And the funniest thing was that when the other guy sat next to me, she went there and sat on his lap too (man, you don't know the feeling of not being able to record this to show on YouTube, It could be one of those videos that only gets 30M of view10 years later)

And we started playing to see if it was just the friend who fell to the ground, or if it was everyone, When the mens in the group hugged me, she ignored it and sometimes licked the others guys too(She licks a lot when she likes someone).....

Now when it was with the girls........

I seriously thought about giving her a gag, because, she bit one of my friends on the hand(It didn't bleed or leave a mark, I think it was that scary bite), and kept pushing the second other As if she was trying to wake someone up, And the another one that went to the ground, went to the ground again, in the same way....


well that was yesterday, and today I want to see if this level of jealousy is normal , I need to correct this or leave it as is? , I honestly don't want to correct it, because I think it's cute, I think, as it won't be a lifelong problem since I don't have women there

I just moved in with her recently, I have only stayed there for 3 nights now. Her 13 year old male jack russell barks at me a lot and he growls but he will come up to me and stand on my leg and let me pet him. He wags his tail a bit. I think he's a bit scared and maybe just talkative. Do you all think he will eventually accept me as a pack member and quit barking at me? I have heard jack russells like to bark a lot so I am not sure it will stop.

My other thought is I am not really there consistently so I think it will take longer for him to adjust to me. What do you all think? Any tips? He will accept treats from me, then proceeds to bark. Part of me worries we're going to get noise complaints from neighbors. He is an ESA with paperwork so I guess she can't really get kicked out because of the noise. I don't really mind dogs barking (although it is loud) as I know it's natural but it's a little offputting and makes me not want to stay there.

I will always miss my sweetie, I know that. But I also believe life goes on and she would have liked me to be happy, not leaving in despair for the rest of my life.

I really hate to use the collar on her, she’s such a sweet girl but even then  it’s not working.

My mom has busy work hours, so I’m usually the one who walks pumpkin. When I’m walking pumpkin, I have no issues. There is no pulling, she knows to listen, if I want her to come, I will whistle, and she knows to come on command. That kind of thing.

When mom walks her, it’s a completely different story. She pulls, she gets overly excited, and she doesn’t listen. This makes mom very irritated, and it just doesn’t go well. 

Last time this happened, Mom looked at me and said that it was basically my fault. That I wasn’t walking her enough, and basically told me that pumpkin had forgotten her leash manners because I wasn’t walking her enough.

After that dispute though, I took the dog out the next day, and again. No issues. At all.

I told Mom that I think the biggest difference is that I will baby talk pumpkin while we walk, reinforce the positive behavior that I want to see, because I have noticed that Mom doesn’t do that.

I don’t know, I just want to fully understand what’s going on, what needs to happen, because I really do not like dealing with my mother when she is irritated, and it stresses out pumpkin too.

I don’t know if Mom needs to train pumpkin specifically in order to get pumpkin to listen to her, or if it’s really just on me here to try to train pumpkin, but I don’t really know how to get pumpkin to listen to Mom.

If I come back she will get up and move immediately, she never tries to keep the spot.

She does this everywhere. The couch, bed, front seat of my truck. She even lies on the floor in front of my computer chair under my desk when I get up from my computer. She lies where my feet would go, and again will get up and move immediately if I come back.

 She doesn't slink off or look appeasing or anything, just gets up and moves out of my way when I come back. She's not really a velcro dog, she will cuddle and be near me often but she also will lie in another room of the house by herself just as often. Sometimes I talk to her when I come back but more often than not I basically ignore it and just go back to whatever I was doing. Meaning, I don't think she's doing it because it gets her something if that makes sense. 

It's not something that bothers or concerns me at all, but I definitely don't understand what's going through her head when she does this. It's the only thing she does that absolutely befuddles me. She's an Aussie, if that matters (I can't see why it would?).

My puppy is now almost 6 months old and is doing amazing with house training and is everything I dreamed of for my first dog..... now he only thing is that he is insistent on getting up earlier and earlier. It started at 5am which is when I normally get up so that was ok and now we have been getting up at 4am for the past week. Here is a little about our routine.

4am - Wake up and a quick potty break - no fun of any kind just outside for a pee and poop and then back in the crate

4:15-4:30 - Back in the crate but starts digging and chewing on the bars.

4:30 - I give up and let him out, I make a cup of coffee and sit on the couch with him watching TV.

5am - Another quick Potty break

5:15 - I feed him breakfast half in a bowl and then half in a slow eater

5:30 - Training session (Short and Sweet)

6-6:30 - Long ish walk (he is not a huge fan of walking, typically just smelling)

630- I give him a bone while I make myself breakfast and get ready for work

7:15 - Take him out one more time for a potty before I head to work

7:30 - 10:30 - Sleep in Crate

10:30 - 11 - 30min walk with dog walker

11 - 1:15 - Crate Time with a bone or other toy (But he mostly just sleeps)

1:15 - 1:45 - Another 30min walk with the dog walker

1:45 - 5:30 - Crate Time

5:30 - 6:30- I get home from work and we go on a walk and to the apartment dog park to run around or just a sniffing walk.

6:30 - 6:45 Training session

6:45 - He eats his dinner

715 - Another quick potty break

730-8 - We play or he just chews on a bone it depends on the day.

8 - 9 - Chill on the couch

9:15 - Last potty Break for the day

The amount of times I got mad at him were about 3x when he peed in my room (no hitting). He is a house dog, so I trained him to go outside to poop and pee (which he does). The problem is, the dogs outside. 

My dog before is really hyper and playful. He is so sweet and loving but the dogs outside, whenever he goes out, would get mad at him. My dog tries his best to be nice to them! I can see him TRYING. He would smell them and they would bark at them, and in turn my dog would show his belly to be submissive. Not until a week ago that the bullying towards him got worse. They would snarl at him even if he's just 4 feet away and I just wanna cry because he's trying his best. Now, he's so submissive and when I move just a little bit, he would try to hide because he thinks I would hurt him 🥲 He sees everyone as a threat now.  What should I do?

They always got along and played very well until one time they were playing tug of war and suddenly started fighting. We’re not sure what happened. The best idea we have is that the pit accidentally got the huskies tongue so he snapped and she thought they were fighting and started attacking him. Hes the only one that had any injuries (she got his snout down to the bone and under his mouth a little) we separated them (kept in the same house with a gate between them) and ever since then the pit acts very nervous around him but he seems fine. I want to reintroduce them but I’m afraid of them fighting again and I’m too small to seperate them as they are both large dogs. The pit got hit by a truck as a pup and had to be crated and carried outside for 16 weeks so she has separation anxiety, jealousy issues, and is a little weary of other animals and humans anyways.

Routine-Budget923,rental unit,5,2024-05-09 14:44:38+00:00,"hey all,

so i am about to move into a new rental house and the landlord notified me yesterday that he noticed fleas in the backyard and has gotten approval to spray the front and backyards. they will also be mowing the yards. not sure when it’ll be done as I have to move in in 2 days but he assured me if it doesn’t get done before i move in, that it’ll be done shortly after.

i wont be taking him in either yard until then, of course, but i’m really nervous about moving in because i don’t want an infestation in the house and i dont want him (or I) to bring in any fleas and risk the cats catching fleas (they don’t go outside). 

they’re all on preventatives (cats are on frontline plus, dog is on simparica) but ive had to deal with a flea infestation yeeeeears ago and it was a b*tch and it left me traumatized because it took FOREVER and i only had my one cat at the time so I can’t even imagine what it’d be like with 4 animals in the home. 

what would be the best course of action in this situation? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cnyzit/rental_unit/
Away-Advantage-8156,Advice for my dog ,0,2024-05-08 20:01:26+00:00,"Hi, this is my first time writing here because I would like some advice on how to succeed in getting my dog used to being indoors instead of in the garden. English is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes.
The situation is a bit complicated:
I have a 7-year-old toy poodle who has always been used to living in the garden ( very very spacious) and then taking him for walks during the day or late evening. The reason why he couldn’t stay inside its because the house is of my parents who didn’t want a dog inside the house since there are a lot of fragile things and they also had the opinion that dogs prefer staying outside. He obviously sleep inside tho, he has a little room for himself lol!
I am about to move and I plan to take my dog with me ( of course) only it is an apartment with a terrace and no garden. he is a very small dog so of the space I am not afraid, what scares me is that the change could be ""traumatic"" for him. Has anyone by chance had a similar experience or has any advice for me ? My dog also has never been ""potty-trained"" living obviously in a garden. When he sleeps inside I always lie down some pet pads but he never made any mess.
He is in every way my dog, I feed him, I take him outside, I play with him, I take him to the vet and so on ; my parents were willing to let me have a dog but they made it clear he is my responsibility and I gladly accept that, so in no way I am going to leave him there.

He’s a 40kg akita, husky, shepherd mix and has just always had squidgy paws despite being an avid hiker. I just purchased ruffwear dog boots for him and had a few questions about them if anyone here has tried them?

-How tight should they be? I don’t want them falling off but I also don’t want to cut off circulation or cause severe discomfort. It also seems that no matter how much I tighten them to top collar of them is a bit stiff and always leave a bit of space.

-I am also worried about the fit. I think I might have got the front ones in too big of a size. I measured my dog’s paw by tracing it and measuring that way. It said it was bigger than the biggest size so I was honestly expecting them to be too small. Now they just seem a little big. To get them tight I have to pull the velcro until the soft part of the velcro is coming through the other side and strapping back down on itself if that makes sense.

-Also, my dog has dew claws. It said to use the socks but they’re such a pain to get on when solo. Does your dog have dew claws and if so do you use the socks or not?

-Finally, I just wondered if it could be bad for the dogs back or anything. Obvs what we wear on our feet can have effects on our spines and I don’t wanna cause a bigger problem (e.g. a bad back) by trying to avoid a smaller existing problem (e.g. cutting his pads)

Also any other solutions are welcome. Some have said mushers secret but that seems more temp and weather based. Not stopping them from cutting their pads on harsh terrain.

He has always hated that I clean his paws before entering the apartment but I managed to get him used to it by offering food every time he allowed me to clean his paws. A few days ago he was laying in the floor resting (not sleeping) and I grabbed his front paws to check for ticks and whatnot, and he was fine with this but then when I went to grab his hind legs, as soon as I touched them he lashed out at me and blt me on the leg. It wasn't a serious blte but it did break skin and bruised. I think he is kinda traumatized because he was spayed 2 months ago and he broke the stitches so we had to take him to the vet for a few days for daily checkups, so my theory is that he had flashbacks as he was probably sleepy and that's why he lashed out.  
After that cleaning his paws has not been the same. I'm always nervous to do it because I feel he will lash out again, so I just clean his front paws.

I would prefer to foster to see if the dogs get along but that’s not an option for the shelter. 

Riley loves our attention and can be territorial over food and toys when a dog comes over. However, at the park and on walks he’s very playful with other dogs and people and gets along with everyone. 

Part of me wanting another dog is because Riley bonds with my husband more though I take care of him 99% of the time. When I met the potentially new dog, he was very loving and affectionate towards me (and my husband). 

Our home is big enough, we can afford it, we have a big yard. 

We are also thinking of having kids in a year or two. So I’m not sure if it’s a good idea from that perspective. I also don’t want Riley to be jealous or sad. And I don’t know if I should look to adopt a younger dog instead.

Basically I’m a very indecisive person and don’t want to make a mistake by adopting another dog.

SimpleLeast,How can I give my dog a good life?,2,2024-05-09 08:36:28+00:00,"Sorry in advance for this long post.

My dog's name is Cova and she is a 3 year old pomeranian. She's gonna be 4 years old this year on August 30. I'm writing this post because I want to know how I can give her a good life. She's currently in my arms being petted, but all I can think about is what I'll do once she grows old and I lose her. It's a morbid thought. The fact that I just turned 20 might be contributing to it. Time is passing by and it makes me anxious. The feeling that I'm not doing enough has been plaguing my mind.

I'm always busy because I work full time in order to pay my college tuition (where I am also a full time student). When I get home, I'm always really tired so I play with my dog for a bit before I have to do assignments. I also try my best to give her good meals, toys, and other things she might need. For example, I have $2k put aside at all times in case she has a medical emergency or needs something etc. Cova is a house dog and she likes to laze around with me. She likes it when I pet her when I study and sleeps with me every night. Despite this, I feel like i should be doing more as a pet owner because most of the time, this is all we do (referring to her just chilling with me). 

I wish I could allocate more time to playing with her, chasing her when she has the zoomies, etc. I don't have the most money, but I also plan to pick up more hours once my college semester ends so I can make her fancier meals once in a while. But then that leads me to the worry that I'm taking even more time away from her. Sorry if my thoughts aren't the most straight forward, but I guess I'm worried that just because I spoil her with material goods, doesn't mean I'm doing a good job taking care of her. I know that 4 years old isn't old at all, but I'm always scared that I'm not giving her the life she deserves. Every time I think about my own life without her, I start tearing up and crying which is what prompted me to write this post in the first place. What if I'm not spending enough time with her? What if she's unhappy? I live with my family too and they don't really put much care into her. Like I just came home from work and they didn't feed her dinner despite me asking them to before leaving the house. She was so hungry and immediately ate all her food (she usually eats half at first, then the other half later). 

I'm saving up to hopefully move out within 2-3 years and I'm going to be taking her with me. But until then, is there anything I can do to make her life more enjoyable? To be a better owner? I love her so much and I really want her to know it. My family always says that I don't take care of her because I don't do things like brush her hair every night or only bathe her every two ish weeks and it gets to my head a lot. I'm not allowed to take her to a groomer because my parents don't trust them so I pretty much handle everhthing regarding Cova. I wish I had more time and energy to put into playing with her. I wish I had more time to consistently groom her. I want her to feel loved and to know she's extremely important to me so if anyone has advice please let me know",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cnsby0/how_can_i_give_my_dog_a_good_life/

Injury happened very suddenly and the lack of mobility is starting to drive him a little crazy - he needs more mental enrichment asap; please help!

---

right now, I'm helping my neighbor with her dog, a white swiss shepherd. Due to a leg cast, he cant do much and although I have only known him a short time, I can see how the lack of mobility is getting to him :( . As a working breed, he is suffering from lack of stimuli/enrichment. 

We always walk him on the same route - it is very short but it takes so long because he walks so slow. So I'm assuming even the walks and smells are boring. He just has a ball that he LOVES to toss around to me and I kick it, but I think he needs more. He knows some commands, so would having him do more tricks help?

He loves to carry things for people, so next time ill bring a small bag he can carry for me. This task gives him a lot of fulfilment from what ive noticed 🥹 - **he likes to feel like he ""serves and protects"" - I think thats his number one thing**

Its so sad to see that he cannot let his energy out physicially. Please equip me with some advice so I can do my best to help him mentally!

His owner loves him like a child but this was a super sudden/complicated injury and due to work + handling the injury process, they have little time for side-effects like boredom when they are more physical urgent needs. So thats where I would like to step in and lighten the load - I know she notices it in her dog as well and would really appreciate it! Thanks!

Krandor1,How to teach pup not to go after trucks?,11,2024-05-09 03:17:09+00:00,"I have an 11 month all Doxie (birthday in about 3 weeks) and she loves going for walks and normally ignores most cars now especially when she is off sniffing.  However when things like FedEx vehicles or some of the larger landscaping trucks come by she runs toward them to the point she often gets on 2 legs.

Obviously this worries me from both a straining on the leach issue and if she ever did get out (which I hope doesn't happen) I worry she'd go running into one of those and get hit.  

I can only assume something about the sound of the larger trucks that is attracting her.  What are some good techniques to teach her not to run toward them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cnne5h/how_to_teach_pup_not_to_go_after_trucks/

Oscagon,Inherited 3 Dachshunds,6,2024-05-09 01:54:45+00:00,"First off, just want to say hi. I’m new here and am looking for some advice. My mother passed away about 2 months ago and I inherited her babies. 3 dachshunds with a ton of personality. I’ve known them since they were little pups so they feel like family to me. One is 3 (Toby - white and brown wired hair with a too much personality), one is 4 (Nessie - long haired and extremely passive and “chill”), the last is 15 (Ruby - short haired with a ton of energy for being as old as she is. **loves to chase mice in the back yard). They’ve all acclimated to me as I moved here last October to help my mother while she was sick, but I have a feeling, they’re just not as happy as they were with my mom. My habits are way different than hers - she was retired and watched tv a lot during the day and sat with them on the couch quite a bit, and I really don’t do that. I guess I’m just reaching out for advice on how to care for them as best as I can. Nessie seems to be a little depressed, as she doesn’t eat much. Toby just wants his ball all day, and Ruby just wants treats 🤣. I haven’t been the best with given them walks as I typically throw the ball for Toby’s exercise.

a bit of an unusual situation: I've moved recently to the US - MI to be exact - from Germany. My two Labs are of course with me. For the most part they were fed a mix like this one:

My question is simple: is anyone here aware of a similar product in the US? Not re-assembled freeze dried designer food, no human-grade or whatever marketing slogan, just parts the butcher would throw out in a mix that is targeted towards dogs. (bonus: at reasonable price)

Geeky_femme,Family with young kids seeking very chill dog,43,2024-05-08 19:56:56+00:00,"**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?** 

Not my first dog. My partner and I both previously adopted shelter dogs. We had them until they passed away of old age, so we have many years of experience of taking care of dogs. She did puppy class with her dog. I adopted an older dog and did not train her. 

**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]**( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))? 

Prefer a rescue, but open to a reputable breeder

**3) Describe your ideal dog.** 

My ideal dog loves kids, is calm but still playful, good with cats, doesn't bark a lot, doesn't shed (listed in order of importance). Our prior dogs were very anxious and we realize that is a trait we do not want in a future dog. 

**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?** 

Any breed that meets the above criteria

**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?** 

Sit, fetch a ball, go to its bed

**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**

No

 **\*\*Care Commitments\*\*** 

**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?** 

We have young kids and work demanding jobs. Realistically, we don't have a ton of time on weekdays. We can devote 15 min/day to training. We would likely take the dog on one long walk per day. The kids will play with the dog on evenings and weekends.

**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

We will probably take the dog on two short and one long walk a day. There is a dog run near us, but it isn't great. 

**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?** 

A little brushing is fine. We're happy to pay for a groomer.

**\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*** 

**10) What size dog are you looking for?** 

Any size is okay, with a preference for a smaller dog.

**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

Not a lot! We have a tenant who can hear everything. And our older kid has sensory issues. Barking and a lot of licking would be hard for us. 

**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

No important

**\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*** 

**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?** 

A little of both.

**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?** 

Either is fine

**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?** 

I would prefer the dog not bark. A friendly greeting to strangers or visitors would be nice, but ignoring them would be okay too. We have a lot of kids coming over and we don't want them being overwhelmed with jumping or barking.

**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?** 

No

**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?** 

We really want to avoid an anxious dog. Our house has a lot of comings and goings. With small kids, we are rarely still. The dog should be calm when there is lots of movement around.

**\*\*Lifestyle\*\*** 

**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

On weekdays, very little, an hour at most. On weekends, up to 6 hours.

**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

My kids just want a dog they can throw a ball with. They are still a little young to really help with pet care. (they are 5 and 8)

**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?** 

A 3 yo male cat. We love him, and he wants to be with us all the time. He and the dog must get along. 

**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?** 

Yes, we have two kids, 5 and 8. 

**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

We own 

**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?** 

Brooklyn, NY. No breed restrictions. 

**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?** 

Summer is 80-90. Winter is 30-40. Fahrenheit. 

**\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\***

 **25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

We recently adopted a rescue who hadn’t been properly vetted. It was a huge mistake. She was completely untrained and asked for things with her teeth. She ended up biting our kid and puncturing his ear. The rescue took her back. We are not yet ready for another dog, but want to plan for one in the future. We love dogs and want another. Our previous dogs were not easy. We’re willing to put in some work, but would prefer an easier dog this time around. I appreciate your help!

She would just be walking and then squat. I’ve also tried taking her on walks but she will just go back and forth a few houses and whines. When I try playing with her she will end up taking the toy and going by herself.

One of her favorite things on days when squirrels are especially up to no good is to sit hunched over with her head sticking out. 

But her number one baffling silly door habit is her frequent refusal to use it when we come home and she’s outside. (If she’s inside and she hears us and we take too long, she’ll come out the doggy door to investigate.)

She stands on the stoop looking hopefully at the doorknob as we get the keys out, wagging her tail, pointedly looking from us to the door. I’ve even pushed the flap and she looks at me before returning to the door knob.

Ok-Minimum-7503,My dog refuses to come inside,1,2024-05-08 14:09:23+00:00,"So as context, I semi-inherited my mom and step-dad's dog (and their two cats and their daughter but that's a story for another time) when they got a divorce last summer. I say semi-inherited because I told my mom and step-dad that I could not keep the dog any longer than August so the problem, such as it is, is only going to last until then.

They did not train the dog and she spent the majority of her life locked inside their dining room behind baby gates for the first two years of her life. So not off to a great start. 

The point is that she's a horribly untrained dog and has absolutely no foundation for me to work on as far as training. This is the first dog I have had experience with where I am the primary care giver. I grew up with dogs but as I was a child didn’t take an active role in training or anything like that. 

I am at a loss as to what to do with this dog. Among many other issues we are having, the main one is that whenever I let her out into my yard, we play ""will she won't she come inside"" for about an hour. I work from home so this is extremely frustrating for me as I have to get up from my desk probably seven or eight times within the hour to try to entice her inside. She is not food motivated and treats do not work. The only thing that will get her inside consistently is if I say ""wanna go on a walk"" which gets her inside but then I have to decide whether or not to take her for a walk right at that moment. As I said I work from home and it may or may not be a good moment. Most of the time, in fact, it is not. I get so fed up with it that 9 times out of 10, I put on my shoes and go into the yard to try to catch her. She loves it when this happens because she thinks it is a fun game we are playing. She is a pitbull and is really fast and I don't feel like adding on broken ankles or dislocated shoulders to my list of sh*t to worry about.

I ordered a tie up rope from Amazon. She hates that too and just stands there when she is attached to it. She refuses to go to the bathroom and if she's not going to go to the bathroom with it on then what is the point of doing that? I need a solution that allows her to enjoy the yard and do her business while also ensuring that I will not have to chase her around the yard to get her inside.

I am at a loss. Any tips or tricks would be so, so welcome at this point. I am so over dealing with this dog and like I said it's only until August but I don't know if I will be able to deal until then.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cn5h8f/my_dog_refuses_to_come_inside/

thisismybackupyall,What to choose!?,0,2024-05-08 04:05:03+00:00,"1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

As an adult, I “inherited” my MIL’s rescue when MIL passed away. He was a maltipoo?mix & had several health issues. He took meds twice a day & had to wear a diaper when we were out because he took diuretics. Not much experience training a dog. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I don’t have a preference other than I would like a smaller dog that sheds very little.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.
A small, low shedding, playful, gentle dog. I would prefer if it didn’t bark too too much 


4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Toy poodle (had one as a teen & he was very intelligent & sweet, little to no shedding), Shih tzu (had one as a young child & I remember her being a perfect princess. She was my first dog & amazing with children), Cavapoo (this is more of low shedding, they’re cute & I have read that they’re good with kids), Miniature Goldendoodle (good with kids, hopefully 😬 best of two popular breeds?), random lil wire-haired terrier mutt from the pound (honestly, this is because they’re cute) 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

They don’t need to do tricks or anything. I’d like them to be house trained & maybe learn “sit”

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Nahh. They’d just be a family pet. 

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 

Many hours. I work from home. I have twin 5 year old girls. 

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

An hour or two. A dog park (if it’s okay with my dog & they’re not too young), walking on the sidewalks in our neighborhood. I could not handle a dog that needed a bunch of exercise daily. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I would comb and/or brush them daily, if necessary. I would clean ears, clip nails, etc. I might have to leave the hair trimming to the experts. I would pay a professional every 4-6 weeks to do a full head-to-toe groom.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

A smaller dog, preferably under 20lbs. 

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Very little shedding, barking when there’s a noise or someone new but not incessantly. Please, not much slobber

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

This is not very important at all. I have a fenced-in yard. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I don’t want a dog up my butt every second of the day, but I do want to snuggle 

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

1 being its own thing & 10 being eager to please: I’m at a 6.5

15)	How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

I would prefer a friendly pup. 

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

It depends on the level of aggression. I would prefer not to deal with it. 

17)	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

I would like to avoid aggression toward my children. I don’t mean children that will pull its tail or intimidate or harm it in some way. Just kids that want to play with it. 

**Lifestyle**

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

I work from home. Besides a visit to the grocery store or *possibly* enough time to catch a movie, he/she would not be alone. 

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

My children want a “puppy that will stay a puppy.” They want a small dog. 

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No other pets as of now. We were thinking of getting a kitten around the same time

21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? 

Yes

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We rent but will likely have bought a house by the time our pup would be with us. I believe there is a breed restriction (no pit bulls or German shepherds, for sure) and I think 50lbs+ weight restriction. 

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Texas does not restrict dog breeds

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Up to 98 degrees F (average) in August & average low of 36 degrees F in January. That August temp seems mighty low though

**Additional Information and Questions**

25)	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

I know I said I have 5 year old twin girls. They listen pretty well and THEY LOVE DOGS. They have been around my SIL’s mini aussiedoodle & they are very gentle with her. They’ve earned her trust & she is very skeptical

First time posting here.

Im having a lot of trouble with my dog when he is tied up next to me.

For example if I'm at the pub and another dog walks past he gets quite aggressive and barks at them, he am American staffy so it can seem quite scary to those that don't know him. 

He has never barked at a person for any reason. 

If we were to walk past another dog the on leash he is totally fine and will say hello nicely, off leash at the dog park is also not a problem.

He's been with me since he's 10 weeks and is now 5 years old, socialised with hundreds of dogs since day one.

I assume this is some form of guarding behaviour, and I've tried to bring friendly dogs near him whilst tied but if he knows them he doesn't do it.

Any help is much appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cmu0t1/dog_aggressive_when_tied_up_next_to_me/
None,BREED,9,2024-05-08 01:01:50+00:00,"**Introduction**

**Mid- 20s adult, living in house with yard in suburbs. Putting out prospective breed ideas now, it still would likely be around 2 years or so before I start seriously looking to get dog 😊**

·       Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

1.     No, have had three dogs, who I still have, two Labrador Retrievers and a Pug. Trained all three dogs and have experience working with other dogs including in school and work (I am not a dog trainer). I have taken my dogs to multiple dog classes (beyond just puppy class) and have earned two titles on one dog. I also have general experience working and training animals so I am familiar with training styles

·       Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

1.     Breeder

·       Describe your ideal dog.

1.     Loyal, even-tempered (not aggressive), intelligent (enough), goofy, interested in training/learning/working but not high energy that they can’t also enjoy an afternoon on the couch (I’m not looking for border collie energy!), dependable (can generally count on temperament to be steady)

·       What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

1.     Curly-Coated Retriever – I’ve met two and thought they were sweet and owner said they were very trainable, graceful, and really loved being by owners side

2.     Flat-Coated Retriever – have heard they are goofy, trainable, and safe, think they are beautiful

3.     Clumber Spaniel – they are just so cute and I like the mellow/goofy vibe they have

4.     Brittany – I’ve known multiple and they are all so sweet and kind but want to work.

·       Breeds I’m not Interested In 

1.     I don’t think I have quite the energy for herding breeds so they aren’t really on my list.

·       What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

1.     Leash walking, basic commands/obedience (sit, down, stay, leave it), but would also like to teach tricks or some kind of activity. 

·       Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

1.     Yes – I am someone who listens to their dog and what they like to do, but would love to do/get involved in in trick training, rally, dock-diving, etc. (Doesn’t have to be all of these, these are just sports I’m interested in). I have experience in tricks as one dog has two trick titles and working on further. I have had introductions to the other listed sports but have not seriously done these with my current dogs. 

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

·       Job is hybrid. My dogs are my life, so I plan to play/interact/train with my dog daily. I like to do training/activity (play/fetch) for at least 30-40 minutes a day and would also devote additional time to walking and multiple hours a day interacting as I like to hang at home with them. 

 

·       How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

1.     I can exercise my dog for 40 minutes-2hours everyday, with more time on the weekends. I plan to exercise through walks, hikes, fetch (if they like it), and dog training/classes/sports. I have a fenced in yard so I don’t really use the dog park anymore, but there is one nearby, but that isn’t a set part of my exercise.

·       How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

1.     I have some experience doing some light grooms and trims and am willing to learn and do those at home or take to a professional. I am willing to groom a few times a week. 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

·       Medium to Large (25 pounds – 100 pounds) 

·       How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

1.     Shedding I don’t care about, I have three dogs who shed a ton and it doesn’t bother me a bit. Barks, I’d prefer less barking (barking to alert there are people at the door/if they see people walking by) but I just don’t want non-stop. Slobber, its fine, I don’t love the thick slobber but some drooking is okay. 

·       How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

1.     Somewhat important – Its ideal and I would love it, but if some areas they are untrustworthy to have off-leash that is okay. I would work on off-leash skills. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

·       A mix, I have both kinds of dogs and enjoy both, would enjoy someone to sit at my feet/next to me while I’m on the couch.

1.     Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

1.     More eager to please, I want some challenge to train but not too much.

1.     How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

1.     Settling nicely and waiting to be acknowledged when entering yard, I am okay/fine with barking when someone knocks or passes yard. I’d prefer dog to be friendly/cordial to strangers/visitors, don’t need over the top but don’t want difficult to introduce (a little selectiveness with strangers is fine)

1.     Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

1.     No

1.     Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

1.     Aggression of any kind 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

·       A few hours for work, but after work/weekends no more than an hour, hour and a half a day.

1.     What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

1.     They like dogs and will help with feeding/restroom breaks in special circumstances but majority/all of care will be on me. 

1.     Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

·       Three dogs (two labs and pug)

1.     Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

1.     No, but occasionally will interact with kids so being safe is ideal.

1.     Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

·       No restriction. 

1.     What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

·       USA, no breed bans where I live, nor are any of the dogs I am considering banned.

1.     What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

1.     70-90F  in summer (sunny, humid-ish), winter 20-40 (can get cold and have snow)

frrstk,How to leave new dog at home during work/extended trips out?,0,2024-05-07 23:51:13+00:00,"My wife and I just brought home a dog four days ago. He’s 12-18 months old, and we believe he’s a Cane Corso/Pit mix. We also have two male cats, 6yo and 2yo. 

So far he’s very well behaved. He barely makes any noise. He knows “sit”, but “stay” and “come here” need work when he’s excited about something. The first few days we kept the cats upstairs, but once we started introducing them he was very nice to the cats, but they’re still warming up to him and like their space. 

He does seem to get a bit nervous if you leave him shut in a room by himself. He cries a little, and scratches at doors. He’s a strong boy so he can leave marks on the door or paint if he keeps it up. 

I’ve been working from home to keep an eye on everything and ease him into the house/routine, so he hasn’t been left at home on his own yet. But I’ll need to go back to the office soon. We’re very nervous to shut him in any rooms because we don’t know if he’ll get destructive towards the doors, furniture, etc. Or absolute worst-case scenario, he somehow escapes his room, gets to the cats and gets too excited and damages something (or someone).  So as much as we hate it, it seems like a crate is the safest and simplest solution. 

We are looking into doggy day cares for extra long trips out.

Is it normal to leave a dog in a crate for an entire work day? I only work in-office three days a week, and I’m usually gone from 7:30am to 5:30-6pm.  And my wife is normally gone from 7am to 3:30pm. (Unless one of us has an appointment or errand right after work.) My work is about a 20 minute drive from home, so I could stop by and check on him during lunch. My wife’s a teacher so she can’t leave and return to work like that. She gets the summer off, so she’ll be able to hang out at home more then.

Any advice on how to leave him at home would be appreciated. How long he can be in the crate, whether or not it’s a good idea to let the cats roam the house while we’re gone. Whatever, any advice is helpful. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cmqjzj/how_to_leave_new_dog_at_home_during_workextended/

thedoc617,High prey drive dog raised with cats but hasn't lived with one for years,1,2024-05-07 19:27:42+00:00,"So we got my standard poodle a little over 4 years ago when we also had a cat and a small Shih Tzu. (Both of them elderly). Both of the elderly pets put the puppy in his place and everyone was fine and knew to give each other space. The poodle and the cat would sleep next to one another and if the poodle got too rough, the cat would put him in his place OR we'd intervene. 
[Pic of poodle and kitty](https://imgur.com/gallery/5AedBi1)
 
The cat and Shih Tzu have since passed away and we are looking to add a new cat to the household but we aren't sure how the poodle will react to a new cat. 

He has a high prey drive and does chase wildlife (he has only caught a bunny once and as soon as the bunny screamed he spat it out and he- the dog-  ran away). 
He is reactive towards other dogs but he's indifferent (or curious) of the stray cats that are in our neighborhood. 

The cat would have their own room for a while while we swap scents and feed them both behind closed doors and also have a cat super highway of shelves and cat trees to be able to get away from the dog if needed.

ThrowawayQNH,Can a Jack Russel be trained not to bark at incoming guests/doorbell ringing?,1,2024-05-07 18:26:34+00:00,"Let me start that I've only had a dog once, more than 20 years ago, when I was a kid. I'm a total noob wrt having a JRT at home or caring for a dog for any extended period of time.

I'm a 39M and I was single for a year after a breakup from a long (marriage-like) relationship. Me and the ex did not have any pets except in few occasions where we cared for a cat for a week or two.

I met this girl, 36F, and things are getting quite serious for the past few months. We're both childless and we're keen on starting a family, plus having one or two kids. She lives with her parents right now. We planned on her moving in to live with me. That would've likely been a fact if it wasn't for the dog. She has a 7-year old male Jack Russel which she loves dearly. Let's call him Rex.

I have an apartment of my own and it is dog-friendly, so there weren't any obstacles.

Before that, she was visiting me a dozen of times, usually with the dog. Recently we tried to see if we get along for longer time span - around 5 days - at my place (me, her and the dog) and frankly, it's been a pain from my side:

* The hairs. They are absolutely everywhere, and its compounded with the endless enthusiasm of Rex to get on top of any furniture. He doesn't like being on the ground.
* The barking. Rex barks for a lot of reasons, including:
   * seeing a cat (he wants to kill them);
   * me separating from him and the GF while walking around. While this is rarely a problem, it makes it hard (for example) to coordinate walks in the park with friends, because he would bark if I get behind or forward to catch up with the friends; i.e. he imposes the walking pace of the whole group;
   * hearing the doorbell, or anybody near the front door. He barks aggressively to anyone outside the front door, be it food delivery, neighbours, or **even me**;
* Basically if small, mundane noises are heard outside the apartment, Rex gets worked up and sometimes barks, which makes it hard to do even afternoon naps. He can only sleep soundly in absolute silence (though GF claims this is because he's in a new place)

Out of these these, the barking at me when I enter my own apartment gets me the most. I have a serious issue with barking, because some years ago, a pack of stray dogs attacked and bit me, so now I have strong dislike of packs of dogs (even if friendly), and, especially, barking of any kind. GF, on the other hand, does not see the barking as a problem, ""it's a dog"" is what she said when I first brought up the issue.

GF says that we might be able to reduce the intensity of the aggression that Rex has towards outsiders and he can be trained to at least not bark at me when I'm going in my own home. But she said I should ask in a forum to get a balanced view. 

**What's your take on that?**

I currently work three days a week 6:30AM - 2:00 PM. The commute there is about 30 minutes, and the commute home is about 30 minutes - 1 hour depending on traffic.

I’m considering not taking the job because of the guilt I would feel leaving him for almost 9-10 hours. I’m also nervous to hire a random person to walk him because I’ve seen too many horror storries and I don’t know how I or my roommate would feel knowing a random person has a key to my apartment.

violet_burn,How to reversibly dog-proof a rented hardwood room?,1,2024-05-06 19:17:33+00:00,"I would like to find a strategy to affix a protective layer to the hardwood floor of a room in my *rented* flat, that would reliably hold against any bodily fluid coming out of a large dog with rock-hard claws.

I may have to host a friend who has a large and very old dog. We both work long hours so at my friend's home, the dog only got to walk twice a day, and I'm not sure we will be able to change that.

Because of that, the dog often has to let all kinds of bodily fluids out in the apartment where it stays (also because of age).

I am thinking of some kind of elastomer floor cover, but I would like to know:

1. Do any of you know of waterproof floor cover glues that can later be removed _without_ leaving glue marks on the hardwood floor? The idea would be that if somehow some fluid goes around the protective layer, the damage could be contained to one piece of hardwood because the glue would make waterproof compartments.

2. I don't just want an area protected, I want the _whole room_ protected. This means I need to be able to cut the coating to size, _and_ have waterproof upward edges that then get somehow glued to the bottom of the walls (using silicone paste maybe?)

3. Has any of you seen such a dog-proofed floor done to size in a durable way (months or years), that could also be fully reversed when I move out, without having to rebuild the old floor from scratch?

Being the huge animal lover that he is, they had a great relationship. Last fall she started going downhill; incontinence, lethargy, reduced appetite, things like that. She passed away January 2nd this year. She was home laying in her bed with me next to her, and she is buried at my childhood home in my parents' garden.

     I live in a semi rural area.   I have neighbors in my subdivision, but corn fields as well.  We take out our 3 dogs (10 year female, 2 year male, 7 month female) out in the back yard to go bathroom and play catch.  The total property is about 1/3rd acre.

   The 10 year female (royalty) is well trained and will stay in the yard.  She will perk up when she something moving (squirrel,  rabbit, etc), but does not  run after out of yard. 

   The 2 year male (charlie) we keep on leash at 1st and as long as he's fetching his ball he behaves, but there are times he will chase after above items.

   The 7 month female (chrissy), we keep on leash as she will bolt.  They all have a harness and chrissy still wants to pull. 

     I got one of those trolley systems so chrissy can move around and explore while I handle thr other 2.

     All in all it works well, but an issue I have seen is that chrissy will sometimes get wrapped around the cord comming down from the trolley.  This is one that has the spring, but I don't want her to get hurt in any fashion.

     I've though of those retractable leashes and though that would be perfect to use instead of the cord.  I'm sure there is a way I can zip tie or attach this to the system, but I wanted to reach out and ask the community if there is already a system in place for this before I Jerry rig something together. 

My intention is for the retractable leash to pick up the slack as chrissy moves and doesn't offer a chance for the slack to get wrapped around a leg.

For further input, they are never out their alone, but I do know it can only take seconds for something to happen while attention is on another dog, so I want to ensure as much safety as possible.  This is one reason I went with a trolley vs a tie down and they all have harnesses and not collars.  Also, a reason I am using the trolley, is we do not have the funds to fence in our back yard as of yet.  This will allow some freedom without risk of running into neighbors yards.

Thank you for any help you might be able to provide.

AGoodOutlook,Can't stop thinking about my dog.,3,2024-05-06 22:52:54+00:00,"Me and my wife had to (chose to) put our 4 year old Staffordshire Bullterrier down after the worst experience of our lives. But I can't stop thinking about him and how much I miss him.

He bit my best friends 1 year old daughter in the back. She's ok luckily. I don't know if I could have handled something worse happening to her. This happened in January. He never bit a human before. He didn't like other dogs except for the ones he played with as a puppy. When we were alone with him at home. Everything was always lovely. He loved cuddling, sleeping between your legs or right next to you.

Anyway, my wife and I had just started trying for our first child. Obviously we couldn't keep him after that incident.

So we started contacting different organizations that might be able to help us but for 2-3 weeks, none of them was able to handle his needs. So the next reasonable option was to put him down. We didn't want to leave him to just anyone cause of this new issue.

It's now many months later and I still can't let go that we did something wrong. That we should have kept him. That it was just a one of happening. I can still hear him walking up the stairs, barking in the garden. Everytime I open the door I want him to come. But he won't. And it hurts every time.

I'm talking with a therapist since my grandma passed away in December as well and I never felt this much sorrow at once before. I just hate this feeling. The only thing keeping me going is that we're currently in week 14 with our first pregnancy. Thinking about my future child is the only times right now when I feel true happiness, since he's gone.

Thanks for reading. I really needed to vent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1clwn9o/cant_stop_thinking_about_my_dog/
Sea-Construction9098,[BREED] Help me figure out a good breed for me.,0,2024-05-06 23:38:54+00:00,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
\* This will not be my first adventure into dog ownership. I have had several dogs of different breeds and temperaments. Currently I have a Wirehaired Pointing Griffon.  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
\* To be completely honest I want a pure breed puppy. Id be ok with rescuing one, but id much rather just go through a good breeder.  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
\* My dog has to be able to keep up with me on days im going, but also be down with having a slow day ever once in a while. Id like them to be relatively friendly with strangers and other dogs. I know a lot of that has to do with training, but you know what I mean. I would like them to be eager to please and intelligent.  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
\* I had a Newfoundland when I was a kid/teen and would absolutely love to have another. However, that’s just not practical right now due to the weather where I live. Its just to hot. I have done some looking and I am intrigued by Brittanys, specifically French Brittanys as opposed to American Brittanys. I also am interested in border collies. Pretty much as long as they are at least like \~35lb id consider it.  
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
\* So this is really dependent on what the dog wants to do I suppose. General obedience definitely. From there though id just kinda figure out what the dog wants to do and is good at and stick with it.  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
\* With my current dog I do FastCat, Dock Diving, and Fetch. All with the AKC.  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
\* I don’t work so I can devote a considerable amount of time with the puppy. Id want them to kinda accompany me around my farm with my other dog while we do stuff.  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
\* So like I said in the last question I have a farm with a TON of room to run around, supervised. We have all sorts of animals and a pool to swim in.   
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
\* While im ok with brushing, cleaning ears, and nails I don’t really wanna deal with hair trimming. So no poodles or doodles. If its just an occasional cut I can get a mobile groomer out to do that every so often no problem.  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
\* greater than or equal to 35 pounds.  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
\* No a huge fan of barking. Shedding and slobber I can deal with. I can deal with a ton.  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
\* Very. So no sighthounds I suppose. We don’t live anywhere near an active road though. As long as they can be trained in recall.  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
\* I prefer a dog that wants to snuggle in the house when we are just hangin out, but independent enough to not be in my space all day.  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  
\* Eager-to-please.  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
\* I would like my dog to be friendly to strangers and visitors or at worst just a little skeptical.  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
\* Not really. I know this has a lot to do with socialization though.  
17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  
\* No excessive barking  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
\* very little. Few hours a week tops.  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
\* My wife has similar opinions to me. She works and is only home at night and the weekends. So its really gonna be me and my other dog and the new puppy most the time.  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
\* Yes, I have a 2yo wirehaired pointing griffon. There are also some cats that hang around our house and barn and keep the rodents away. So I suppose its gotta be ok with cats.  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
\* Not really. We don’t have any kids, but if we bring the pup into town there are kids they will encounter.  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
\* No.  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
\* I live in Alabama. There are no laws im aware of.  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
\* It gets to about 90 on a summer day and hangs around 30 on a winter day.  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

\* No additional information.

sheilag33,What kind of dog should I get? ,6,2024-05-07 02:09:48+00:00,"Hello everyone, below please find my filled-out dog breed questionnaire. I am very interested in getting a dog and thought this would be a good place to start. I work a full time hybrid job that requires me to travel on occasion (3 to 4 days a month on average) and also go into the office on occasion (once every other week on average) though I go in often (2 to 3 times a week) as I feel more productive that way. My entire life, I have always been extremely fond of dogs and have always debated getting one for my self. I feel as though I am ready now for one.  



**1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

No, but I did not take I had a family dog growing up, she passed away after 17 years. The responsibility was split between my family, though my parents did most of the work. I used to take her on walks, feed her, give her daily medicine, bathe her on occasion, etc.  



**2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a** [**reputable breeder**](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)**?**

I debate this, I will look at rescue centers first but if I don’t find one that works for me, I will look to breeder.   



**3)Describe your ideal dog.**

Loving, loyal, adaptable, small to medium, not much shedding (I have allergies but not too bad to most dogs,) medium activity level, not a puller one leash. I live in an apartment building in a big city with no car.

  

**4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

I also debate this. I am open to rescue and fully okay with adopting a mutt, my dog really want I think is most important is what I shared above. 

If I went to a breeder, I feel like to breeds I’d be interested in are out of my scope of what I am able to do. I love the look of dalmatians blue heelers. Blue heelers loyalty and intelligence sound so intriguing but they require extreme activity am I’m scared a city life style for someone with a fulltime job may be may be a lot to handle and lead to selfishness to the dog – though I’d like to believe I’d be the best I could to do the dog right. 



**5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?** 

Tricks, house manners nothing crazy… 



**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**

 NA



\*\*Care Commitments\*\*



 **7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

A couple hours a day.



**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**   

I’d be okay with taking her for walks 1 to 2 times a day – I go for jogs a few times a week – and I’d be open to jogging more to exercise her. I have dog parks nearby but they’re a bit small – I would be willing to take her to bigger ones 1 or 2 times a week too. 



**9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

I don’t really want to groom my dog – I’d be willing to pay a professional but not often too as I’d rather not spend money on that. 

 

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

 

**10)What size dog are you looking for?**

Max 35 pounds

 

**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

I’d prefer less shedding. Dog’s are obviously going to bark but  I live in an apartment building so less barking the better. Little to no slobber! 

 

**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

Not important as I live in a city but if I do move somewhere else that sounds cool. 



\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

 

**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

Snuggly for sure but doesn’t need to want it 24/7. I want a loving dog. 

 

**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

I think eager to please would be awesome – but does that mean ma need for more attention? 

 

**15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**   

Some barking is fine and understandable but I don’t want a dog that will bark for 20 minutes. I don’t want my dog to jump but I assume that will come with training. Being in the city, the dog will be around strangers constantly. 

 

**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

No

 

**17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?** 

Biting and bad manners 

 

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

 

**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

About 4 times a week. Potentially for 4-5 hours if I come home at lunchtime or work at home, and up to 8 hours a day a few times a week 

 

**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?** 

 I live with roommates but I will be the primary care giver ­– I don't want to depend on them and will not have expectations for their involvement.  

 

**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**

No

 

**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

 Not regularly. Maybe occasionally in the park and in public, but generally I will keep the dog away from children and I have no children in my life, family, friend group etc.

I rent now, I will live in places that allow for dogs. 

 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

North East USA – and will likely live in South Florida eventually.

 

**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

Summer high is avg \~90°F lows are avg \~25°F  in winter

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

I am in a point in my life where I feel a bit stagnant. I’ve wanted my own dog for years and years – I think finally getting one will give me newfound purpose, teach my patience, help change my priorities for the better, and maybe help me learn to better love. I am looking for a companion and a best friend. 

I am open to feedback, additional questions, further conversation on this. Thank you in advance to the community.

Boomhauer_-,Need advice on my current adoptee..,2,2024-05-07 00:15:32+00:00,"So I went in to the shelter last week to adopt a dog and found this beautiful GSD pup (5 months old) and did the paper work to adopt. They told me that he wasn’t neutered so that they’d have to do that before I can take him home and that they’d do it within two days, Well two days later I went in and they said that they weren’t going to do surgeries until the next week so I asked if I could spend time and play with him and they agreed and it was fun he was healthy and full of life. Fast forward to today and they called me but I was at work so they called my emergency contact which is my brother and told him that they neutered him but he had contracted Parvo. They asked him if we’d still be willing to adopt him and if so they would treat him for a day and pass him onto us. But I’ve been looking into it and the survival rate of Parvo particularly in younger dogs doesn’t seem to be to good even if you take them to the vet and now I’m not sure what I should do. I was really looking forward to bringing him home but I don’t want to do that and spend a chunk of money on vet bills if their is a high chance that he may pass away very soon. I also have cats 1 indoor and 1 outdoor/indoor and I’m not really sure if they could get sick if they were to get too close to him. Have any of you had to deal with Parvo on one of your dogs if so how much did you spend at the vet and did they recover well?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1clyfp3/need_advice_on_my_current_adoptee/
